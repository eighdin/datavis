G3Kxhq7gXBZRGK-lo7vPXg,5,"We love Debbie does Doberge so we had to try Debbie on the levee! We were not disappointed. The place has a cute retro diner vibe. We tried the risky biscuit which came with raspberry jam, bacon jam, and whipped butter, a fig and white chocolate dobite, and a slice of cookies and cream doberge. I loved the bacon jam (savory and sweet) as well as the raspberry jam (fresh and tart). The dobite (almost like a petit fore) was excellent as well- the sweetness was tame compared to their other flavors. Lastly, the cookies and cream doberge slice was heavenly. We will be back!",10/25/2020 17:05

dhvQGkATeIvvkxoyYtjhig,1,"These guys come around every few months trying to sell me siding or windows. I entertained them one time thinking it could not hurt to get an estimate, but they would not just get down to the task of doing that. Instead the salesman put me on the phone with his supervisor. This seemed weird. After a few minutes of this it became clear they were using the kind of sales tactics designed to wear you down that other reviewers have mentioned. So I handed him back the phone. 

Since then they have knocked on my door at least twice. The most recent time I very politely told them I was not interested and even added ""Have a nice day. Stay safe."" But they would not take no for an answer and every time I tried to go back inside they kept trying to sell me. I don't appreciate being treated like just someone you can sell things to and told him that. Avoid this company.",8/15/2020 15:10
6jaYLFWJW3gj2qh4g_Yv3g,5,"La Caleñita this morning made me beat anyone's 800# mark.  We picked up friends around 9:45 AM.  We all live in the Center City on this day a nice quite drive of about 15-20 minutes. It was a beautiful sunny morning with a bit of wind reminding you that winter was just here and if that nature wants it can turn around and makes us miserable in a less than a blink of an eye (shouldn't that be blink of the eyes).

I would tell you that if you are looking for some fancy joint with ultra hot Latin Americans just slightly malnourished so that they fit in their designer outfits and a chic decor this would not be the place.  Is in Northeast Philadelphia on north 5th Street.  Small place hard to find unless you know the colors of the Colombian Flag decorated across the middle with the establishments name.  The group consisted of a good Colombian friend with her husband and my partner and I (also Hispanic).  
I would advise to invite a friend that knows to speak fluent Spanish or you can always point at what you want and go for it as you can see everything through a pastry showcase.  The establishment is set up as a bakery even thought you can get items that you would generally not expect to be served in one.  

If you order coffee make sure that you specify without sugar because all coffee served comes with it included. Of course it comes included I mean they already poured about seven spoons of sugar in your cup.

The food is truly authentic and made fresh. The place is so popular that they need to constantly refill their hot foods. Get there before the after church crowd arrives; trust me.

The tamales are the biggest one's I have seen from here to Bogotá, made with large pieces of chicken inside ,potatoes and peas. They melt in your mouth and are delicious.  
They prepare two kinds of  are arepas to keep it simple the white ones are not sweet and have been sliced through the middle to add the single most important food group: Cheese;  and the yellow ones are sweet.  There is Colombian chorizo which is like a mildly spicy Kielbasa not like the traditional Spanish one. Consider also the empanadas caleñas, orejitas, tres leches, etc. 

The cleanliness of the place is superb. The staff is friendly, courteous and attractive but not starved.  Very inexpensive so do not ignore the tip jar on the counter.  Tipping is not a place in China!!!

Is definite worth the trip!!!",4/5/2009 20:13
kxj7TPtJY2zbEjGV0PYfAA,3,"On my ""Visits to the Ballparks of America Tour,"" I recently visited Busch Stadium and quite enjoyed myself.  This stadium had all of the normal, modern amenities but there wasn't anything terribly unique about it, save for the view of the Arch that you get from certain seats and places in the stadium.  

I like stadiums that have things for people to do.  Yes, I like watching baseball games, but if it's two teams I don't necessarily care about, I like to be able to wander around and find things to do.  Unfortunately, Busch Stadium doesn't have much of that happening.  Just a lot of food and beer.

Not even any unique food choices, either.  Some ballparks have local specialties (Philly Cheesesteaks, Clam Chowdah, Elotes, etc.) and apparently Busch Stadium does not.  Only a ton of Budweiser brand beer.  

Tickets are at least cheap enough (this is still a stadium that offers standing-room only tickets and cheaply priced bleacher seats) that you can wander around with your cheap ticket and find another place to sit and no one will kick you out.

Glad I had the opportunity to go and, since it's so close, will probably be back again but this stadium isn't really anything special.",2/6/2016 4:22
f5KxH3YahdmVBgS1axPoWg,4,"We had no intentions on going to Snap for lunch on the day we went; the Beau and I had just been wandering south of the area, and after a long stroll through Philly's Magic Garden, we wanted something quick and simple. As we walked back to our hotel, Snap caught my eye. A tad hangry, I decided this was our option. I didn't go in expecting too much...but let me tell you, the bar was raised much beyond my expectations! 

The concept is similar to &pizza in NYC, I found: pick from a menu or pick your own custom toppings, and have it made in a flash! Within ten minute, I had ordered, had two pizzas, and was on my way out the door again! 

He ordered the Margherita, which was wonderfully made: sure, it's just tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil, like any other, but the preparation of the crust really sold me on it! It was crisp yet doughy, despite its thinness. Great crust or go home! But...the Bianco Verde...THE BIANCO VERDE...OH. MY. GOD. I am a huge white pizza fan, but this was in another stratosphere! There was shredded mozzarella, housemade fresh mozzerella, ricotta, basil, and HERBED BUTTER. The butter sold it for me. I could have eaten it all by myself...well, I did, but I had to share two bites, which made me sad. Ha! 

This is definitely a place to get excellent pizza fast at a good price. Sitting here in NYC, I'm thinking about that Bianco Verde and wishing I was 100 miles to the south, eating it right now. Don't sleep on this place if you're in Philly! Absolutely worth it!",12/14/2017 18:45

NNgQ8fV5ARQgHw-Ob7l50A,1,"Wanna get to your flight on time with the most possible stress? Then Central Airpark is for you. 

Let me set the scene for you - . It's cold out. You think to yourself that there's something strangely comical about arriving at an airport parking lot at 5AM only to see no shuttles in sight and no conceivable signs of life anywhere. As you wait a few minutes and lose faith in the arrival of your savior shuttle, you walk up to the toll window only to see nobody there and no sign indicating whether or not anyone will be there. You will call their phone number only to hear their phone ring from within the office and nobody will come out to assist you. Stricken with panic, you will run back to your car, temporarily forgetting how cold it is, temporarily forgetting all that's been lost about what used to be your humanity. You will pull up to the toll booth to see a heavy gate blocking your way. You will honk. You will honk hoping that the heavens (or at least someone with a way to open this damn gate) will hear you. You will contemplate ramming the gate and using Spot parking (right across the street and looking very much open) so that you can get to your flight on time. In a last ditch effort, you will try the door of the tollkeeper's office and cross the threshold. Inside the belly of the beast - Putting your physical presence inside of this office will awaken the gatekeeper from her humble slumber. She will look at you as if you are the one annoying her - as if you are the one who is possibly invalidating her 400 dollar plane ticket that is not exchangeable and not refundable. You will exchange quick words and she will assure you that the shuttle is on its way. Tired and unwilling to risk any more disappointment, you will reluctantly stay...

...and they will cancel your frequent parker's card. They will ignore any and all attempts for you to get it reactivated. They will conveniently forget that you've been parking here reliably for about 4 years. They will forget all the times you've forgiven them for taking 25 minutes to show up after picking up your luggage. Central Airpark is a poorly-run company with nothing but contempt for its customer base. I've rarely wanted a business to wither and die the way I want this one to.",12/17/2013 14:32
cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,3,"I do not live in Edmonton anymore, but needed to get my mom's carpet cleaned.  I found this company to be reasonably priced and from the reviews they seem to do a good job.  My mother is a heavy smoker, so the house had nicotine stains underneath the sofas.  The owner, Dominic went to the house with another technician to do the carpet cleaning.  He did a good job removing the stains, but was not as attentive to the edges of the stairs and closets.  Overall, for the price, he didn't do a bad job.  I would recommend this carpet cleaning company to others.",9/2/2015 7:54
FXW16a1QddonpF-h3NtxPg,4,"I am really surprised that I have yet composed  a review for this place. I have been patronizing  this place for years since I started working in Philadelphia. I love the seasonal beers, the service here is top notch, and the staff is super friendly and very attentive to the needs of the customers. 

The menu at Pete's carries the usual bar items,  but it does not taste like your typical  bar food. In addition to the typical bar fare, the menu contains other specialty items like the empanadas that enhances the menu.  The fish & chips  is probably one of my favorite dishes. If you love french fries, you are going to love the french fries at Pete's.

2uzH6U_kGVOBIIJoZOOUPw,4,"BEST CHICKEN SOUP EVER.

Seriously, the soup-making skills of Mama Jovan (let's call her that; I don't actually know her name) are OUT OF THIS FRIGGIN' WORLD. This soup will make you feel like your favorite grandma just hugged you and kissed you and covered you in a crocheted blanket on the couch while slipping you pieces of candy every hour on the hour. It's the cure-all, for sure. The ultimate better-than-your-mom's chicken soup. Fresh meat, flavorful broth, big hunks of carrot. Simple with no frills, as chicken soup should be. And it's served with nearly half a loaf of crusty bread. Oh, and lots of napkins. (Sometimes, I don't even buy napkins for my house when I run out; I call in a food order at Jovan's!)

Other wonderfully delicious items at Jovan's include the bruschetta and the burger. But be warned: the food is prepared as you order, which means it's going to take a while (but taste amazing). If you live nearby and pop in to order your food to-go, don't fret about waiting. Grab a drink at the bar and chat it up with the bartender. He's friendly, as are Mama and her husband, who both work the kitchen.

Wok N Roll runs nice special on the combo meals.  The Pork Fried Rice, Dumplings, and Egg Drop Soup are my favorite items on the menu.  A lot of their dishes taste similar such as the Kung Pao Chicken and the General Tso Chicken.",1/17/2013 19:48

mMK0ZqT4Y6wmu5tuwPYVxw,1,"Camping World is absolutely inexcusably awful!!! My husband and I went there last night in search of a travel trailer. Geoff seemed to be a very nice and honest salesman at first. But as we were looking at thier inventory, I mentioned that I wanted to look at one other place before we made a decision. His demeanor suddenly changed and he started questioning me as to where else I wanted to look and why. I gave him the name of the other dealership and he his response was ""well we own them"". He then proceeded to express the fact that what we are looking for sells fast so we needed to make a decision
The pressure was on. I asked if we could all look at the inventory on line together and he was happy to help. Come to find out, my husband noticed that the search he did was customized to above our budget. Long story short we ended up giving them a HOLDING deposit of $500 and told that we needed to contact him when the financing got approved prior to them prepping it for sale.
We found a better trailer that would meet our family needs much better for a similar price at another dealership. When we called Geoff at Camping World to inform him of our new find, we were absolutely appalled at his response. He not only was absolutely disrespectful, he threatened to send us a bill for the work that had been done to the trailer, send our information to ""management"" prior to hanging up on us. Please keep in mind, we didn't request any work be done, we never signed any paperwork promising to buy the trailer. 
If that isn't bad enough, we stopped in to get our holding deposit check back and they refused to give it to back to us.
I'm not usually a person that complains about companies or customer service because I know we all have our bad days. But this is absolutely inexcusably wrong!!! Not to mention illegal!!! BBB will be getting a phone call about this.",4/17/2021 3:28

5RHa6ARjqHnjkk2puc5y_w,3,"Buck-a-shuck Mondays!  I love how close there is a new oyster house so close to my work building.  It's such a pain getting to center city Oyster House and it's always packed for Happy hour.  Now there is another $1 oyster place in the city.  Doc Magrogan's recently opened and is part of a chain.  Their only weekly special so far is the $1 oysters on Mondays from 4-10pm.  They had four different oysters at this price!  Pretty good deal and the oysters were fresh and nicely shucked.  

We also tried some of their regular menu.  I love me some lobster roll but this was a bit disappointing for me.  Comparing to Oyster House, Doc's lobster roll was lacking.  Their bread to lobster ratio was off and didn't have as much flavor.  The crab cake was just alright.  I appreciate being able to see chunks of crab meat but it wasn't spectacular.  

I have been craving fish and chips for a long time (oh Codmother, I miss you).  Doc's fish and chips was pretty terrible.  The batter had absolutely no flavor.  Can you just imagine eating fried paper?  I had to douse it in tartar sauce.  What a shame.

Definitely come here for Buck-a-Shuck Mondays, everything else needs improvement.",8/7/2012 13:48
psAjVE1E1XEYyZ4yTfcdYA,5,"This place was everything I expected it to be. We went on a Friday for lunch and we were greeted as soon as we arrived. I ended up ordering the combo with the classic burger with fries and a drink. That ended up being just about$12 so it wasn't cheap but the quality was there to warrant the higher prices. And let's face it, you pay upwards of $8 at regular fast food places so this wasn't that far off. To me, a delicious burger is all about the bun. The brioche bun was fresh, spongy and tasty. All of the rest of the ingredients were good also. The fries were also really good thanks to all of the dipping sauces. My favorites were the sweet chili and bbq sauce. I'm not too into curry but if you are their Curry ketchup is amazing. I definitely plan on returning. Awesome burger!",2/5/2018 4:40

We sat down right away and they brought us menus, then they took our drink orders. But the poor gal working there was there alone for about the first half hour that we were there so she was just trying to juggle 5 tables which I know is hard. But after she took our orders, reinforcements showed up, our food came out quickly PLUS she had 2 additional people to help with the lunch rush. I ordered the General Tso's chicken which came with veggies, fried rice, an egg roll and a soup for an extra $1! Everything was hot, delicious and fresh. Our office will be moving closer to Thai China Bistro so I hope to become a regular there very soon!",12/12/2017 23:08
26Jc2vMTOKXGOwTy729a3g,4,"Finally got to go down and check this place out! I went before the hockey game, and it's a great spot to do that. Service and food was very fast, and have lots of little small plates that are very reasonable price wise. We tried a mixed bag for food & a couple different drinks. They have an extensive beer can and draft list so if you're a beer connoisseur this is definitely the place for you.  Sea Change Blonde for me. The Sauv Blanc was nice as well. 

For food we tried to TaQuito's which were absolutely fantastic. Just like the one at 7-Eleven except think fresh homemade, they're filled with ham and cheese with mustard dipping sauce and we're awesome... So good I didn't get a picture! 

We then went with the burger, nacho broccoli, jerk chicken, grilled cheese and pickled eggs. Burger was awesome and you can get one to four patties... Really nice, like a homemade burger. Also that jerk chicken spicing was fantastic. A little bit of heat hits you late, and almost everything on the menu was only $10. I cannot stress the value here it is incredible!

I'll definitely be back for some casual, comfort food, or before the hockey game... Daily specials look really good as well. Great new fun casual place on 10 fourth Street",9/17/2019 17:40

Once I was ready she didn't try to sell me anything extra, she explained the warranty and the special they had going.  

This location is bigger than the Clearwater location. I highly recommend coming to Macy's for any furniture shop you may be considering.

They have one of those giant 90"" LED TVs sitting up front, millions of tires for your car, and lots and lots of massive quantities of food. They have a cheese ball container that is the largest I have ever seen... must have 5000 cheese balls in there... enough to shock even Honey Boo Boo chilllle.

_sWha3z3xUK_BXqjl9DPaA,4,"Went here because of all the recent rave reviews on Yelp. I guess it set my expectations too high. I thought the service was good and the price was reasonable. However, I would not give this place 5 stars.

I got a mani and pedi for $40. Made an appointment for Monday at 5pm. Got there at 4:40 and no one was in. I ended up with a Hispanic technician called Isabelle [SP?]. She barely spoke any English but did a scrupulous job on my feet. The hot stone calf massage and the foot massage was nice but only lasted maybe 4 minutes total. I asked her to make the water hotter during the pedicure but she didn't understand me. For the manicure, I got a 1 minute hand massage and another 1 minute neck massage after she had shaped my nails and clipped my cuticle. Felt really good but again, short. 

What I didn't like was that my technician went rough with he cuticle pusher.  I ended up getting a cut on my right pinky. It still hurts and still stings 3 days later! It was also weird that they asked me to pay first before I got my nails painted. The worst part about the experience was that everyone in the establishment was dead silent except for the owners that were playing on the iPads and the only tv that was there was put on some lame beauty infomercial channel. The whole atmosphere felt sorta tense. No one made any conversation. Also, I was not offered anything to drink.

The whole ordeal took maybe an hour and 15 minutes. My manicure was done with Essie and Opi Polish and it already chipped. I have to try gel next time. Overall, Isabelle did not do a bad job but I just didn't feel relaxed or especially pampered from the experience.",11/13/2015 0:33

One of the best things I ever put in my mouth. The house Bloody Mary had me saying Hail Marys after every sip it was soooo good. And the service was exceptional. Our waiter was quick, not hovering and friendly. And the table next to us was a group of fabulous wig wearing dolls out for a bachelorette. Their waitress didn't skip a beat.

arClkvdti1PnM2vhILmFeg,2,"I'll spare the details concerning how we came to agree on a new roof.  It's honestly the same except instead of a Sam's Club or BJ's, they canvassed some neighborhoods.  We were interested in a new roof anyway.

The sales pitch is long.  I told our sales guy that I was okay with the material, polypropylene woven fiber, because I was familiar with it due to my profession.  I knew it wouldn't be cheap.  That said, he told me it was required that he finish his sales pitch even if I was okay with the price and the materials.  But that's not what the 2 stars is for since I'm okay with people doing their jobs.  There were a few issues, two I consider major, which is the cause of this poor review.

The small issue was that we needed to contact our insurance for an inspection first.  Because of that we scheduled the repair 2 weeks out, but then within a couple of days the manager for the actual work was at our home and tried to schedule it for just a few days after that.  So either the sales guy didn't know this would happen or knew and lied.  If he didn't know?  Then they need better communication or they risk annoying some customers, like me!  They need to give people time to get their financial and insurance stuff together if they care as much as they claim! 

Their sales pitch is that their employees are not day labor, wear hard hats and harnesses as PPE, physically cover the side of your home and make sure everything is directly disposed and there is no debris all over your yard.  The first crew to show up that was tearing up the roof wore no PPE and covered NOTHING in our yard!  They just threw a piece of tarp down - didn't even straighten it out- and then just threw it near the tarp.  This brings me to issue #2: debris was falling into our AC unit and my husband had to tell them to cover it.  Their covering was to lean a piece of particle board against it which is nothing like what they show you during their sales pitch.  So don't believe this BS hype because that's all it is!  The group of guys actually putting the roof on wore a harness, but no hard hats.  Luckily they are insured, but I took pics using my home camera of their work to be safe.  My husband also went out into the yard and took some pics while they were doing work.  

And the last reason they get 2 stars?  We found a small issue within the week, my husband called to talk their warranty group and left a message.  They never returned our call.  I has been taken care of, but they should return their customer's calls especially within a week of a new install.  

They didn't replace any interior beams like they said they would though.  The sales guy and another inspector marked several beams they claimed they would replace - this is just another BS sales pitch since they only replaced one!  So don't buy their claims about upgrading all of your old or damaged roofing.  Don't even use them because they use polypropylene (PP) - get several opinions and go with whatever you want.  They try to make it sound like they stand out and are different from beginning to end, but the only difference I can see is the polymer instead of tar paper.  Other than this, the roof looks fine and most of the people we dealt with were nice.",3/1/2020 3:41

While the others in my party were getting their services done I enjoyed sitting by the pool in my robe and then hopped into the hot tub got a bit.

h_erVp39Nr3tjZxEJk-6NQ,4,"Four stars for a decent size Latin grocer that happens to serve some pretty solid food. 
This is probably the most well stocked Latin grocer that I have come across since moving down to Clearwater. They have everything you would want to make a great cinco de mayo party including a piñata if the margaritas make you aggressive (they don't sell tequila). 
They have rows of beans, tortillas, sauces, fresh poblanos, avocados, along with a great selection of dried spices and peppers. 
I tried three different types of tacos with the steak being on point but the chorizo and pastor not holding up to others in the area. All in all they weren't the best tacos but I would come back for them and at 1.99 each it was a generous portion of filling. 
It is a bit intimidating if you do not know Spanish as the hand written menu is only in Spanish but the very polite lady that took my order will gladly translate it for you if you ask. 
They have plenty of seating inside so you can get the order to go or eat there. 
I will definitely be back as each time I've gone it has a good crowd ordering some food and/or getting groceries.",1/22/2017 16:44

The laundry facilities don't work half the time. It took me two weeks to move in from the actual move in date because of the leaking ceiling which they waited ALL day to inform me. 3 months later the ceiling started leaking again. There are termites everywhere and in the laundry facility!! I'm absolutely appalled. I should've ran at the first sign of move in but I didn't think it would be all downhill from here.

g0_x4kVvJAYuk96oCcbOmw,2,"So, I stopped by tonight with some friends and we were cut off from the downstairs bar by a forced invitation to the upstairs lounge. Normally not an issue, but one of our company had muscular dystrophy and stairs were a challenge. We assisted our friend up in expectation of the fantastic beverages that were to come. Tonight especially, a taste of 'Root'; the new locally brewed spirit.

We sat at the very small upstairs bar and were given samples of root. It was very nice, a bit sweet for me, and discussed the possibility of mixing it with a prosecca to enhance the base flavors and tone down the sweet.

Unfortunately for us, Nick and Christian were no where to be found, so our discussions were for naught. The waitress who assisted us had no mixology skill, and Sam, the official barkeep, said not ONE WORD to us the hour we were there, nor did he bother to make a drink for us or inquire if we wanted one.

The waitress ended up making our drinks, which we agreed were lame and tame compared to the vivid flavors we are used to from this place. We considered a second round, but after waiting for fifteen minutes with dry glassware I finally gave in and tendered my credit card, paying forty five (yes $45) dollars for the three drinks we had. 

When we first starting coming here, drinks were great, service was brilliant, and we were excited to be part of the Apothecary scene. It sadly seems that as the name has shrunk, so have all other aspects of this bar/lounge, except the price. (The hours have even been cut to wed-sun!)

Sorry Tony, just as we had to walk away from RAW when you cut back the quality, we now have to walk away from here.

So no longer can I recommend the Apothecary, as now its simply APO, and although there's lots of lipstick on this pig, it's not the Marilyn we once loved.",7/3/2009 0:58

We are outside due to COVID and the inside being pretty busy/full, there were more people than I was comfortable with being around. The outside dining was completely empty, probably in part being the chilly weather. On that particular evening the wind was blowing right down 1st and the dining is completely unprotected. 

The food: I ordered the 1st Ave, Candy Cane and Mexican rolls. All were delicious and discounted since we dined on a Monday (their happy hour day). We ordered the jalapeño w/tuna appetizer recommended by my friend who had it before.

I got a iced vanilla latte and my boyfriend got the Mint Dream. Something was just off. It was not smooth at all. The coffee tasted really bitter? Or burnt?

She explained that they have fresh chef inspired lunch and dinner specials everyday. Their chef tends to have more Asian infused influences. I thought that was kind of unique. We tried the buffalo chicken flatbread which was super good! Personally I like the extra thin crispy crust if I eat flatbreads at all. This one was superb! 

My husband ordered the chicken Caesar salad. Chicken, diced egg and croutons lay on whole romaine leaves. Wow! It looked amazing. Hubby said he would order again in a heartbeat. I ordered chicken tortilla salad. It was by far the freshest chicken and veggies I've had in a chain type restaurant. The chicken definitely has never been frozen. 

I'm so ecstatic I found this neighborhood bar/grille. We can not wait for Sunday brunch. The chef prepares a fresh new menu every Sunday. This is exactly what we have been looking for since we moved a year ago. Excellent service from Laura. She has given us many reasons to return!",9/14/2019 16:59

5QRQJNdt3p6E7FWR9FEX3A,5,"Welcome to the coffee version of Cheers...The Mocha Nut Coffee Shop, where everyone knows your name!

This locally owned coffee shop on the south side prides itself on getting to know their customers. Every time I walk in I get greeted by name! The baristas are so nice and friendly - very sweet folks. Luckily they are not just nice, but make some great coffee! 

Per my first review, I still love the lavender latte. Their seasonal lattes have been fun to try (fall was my favorite). My staple is a pour over. They have two consistent ones and then a rotating brew. Right now it's a Tinker coffee. The consistent ones are medium or dark roast but usually the rotating one is light (which I vastly prefer!). 

The seating is great! This place is usually pretty busy, as a head's up, most of the time. They have some comfy sitting chairs in a couple corners, have a high table with stools running across the window, and tables of varying sizes. The high tables and a couple of the corner areas have outlets, so bring your charger if you're working or studying on a laptop. 

During warmer weather, you'll want to try the patio at the back of the shop. It's delightful and adorable! 

They have an online order option, both a website and an app. Usually takes only 10-15 min for your brew to be ready. Sometimes they even write nice things on your to-go cup! :) 

The snacks are good as well - their pumpkin muffin is surprisingly great (I am surprised only because I usually hate that flavor) but their chocolate chip cookies are my favorite. 

Parking is great, with spots in front, on the side, and behind the shop. There's a door at the back of the shop so feel free to park in the back. 

Also important for folks who plan to be there a couple hours: bathrooms are really nice and clean. 

Anyways, this is my top coffee shop in the city and we are very lucky to have this within the chain-store happy south side (within a 2 mile radius are 3 Starbucks).",12/17/2021 0:47

-two new tires
-windshield wipers
-air filter
-steering alignment
So that'll be $300 please. 

HMMMM. 

I said, an alignment? You just aligned them 6 weeks ago (had this done, same location, in November) They said oh, well just recommend it. I said, is it really in need of a realignment? He said, I don't know. I said ""can't you tell?"" he said no. Hmmm so if you can't tell how do you know I need this $80 service? Just wondering. 

For the record, I take good care of my car and it has less than 25K miles on it, the filter is fine, the wipers work well, just had them on yesterday and there they were, wiping their little hearts out. The tires, as soon as I got home I checked the treads and they totally passed the penny test.

I'll say, for a brief period, my heart ached, and I do still pine for a beef burrito. But that being said, when I built the courage to go to Honest Tom's again a few months back, I couldn't believe the new product. So many places that switch to plant based, end up just trying to figure out how to make something taste as similar to meat as possible. Honest Tom's does so well because they are building meal options that are specific culinary items. The Biff burrito is not simply a beef replacement, it's an entity by itself. It has a totally different flavor profile than the original beef burrito in the best way possible. You can absolutely tell that tons of time was taken to really evaluate how to make the most of the switch-over, and although I do miss some of their original options, their new options are absolutely great ones.",4/28/2019 17:39

 Came here for a New Year's Eve dinner. Made a last minute reservation so only outdoor seating available. Since it was NYE As expected service wasn't 100%. We understood. I was thoroughly impressed with the food for dinner. I've been for brunch 3 times and this is my 1st dinner experience. I wasn't expecting the dinner items to be so good because when I think of the library, just like their sister restaurant  Oxford Exchange,  I think about great brunch food. My boyfriend and I agreed we may like them better for dinner rather than brunch.  Our favorite dish that took us by surprise was the  benne cauliflower -sweet Thai chili roasted cauliflower. Perfection of sweet and spicy. One of the best cauliflower dish we've had and we've had some great ones at On Swann for example.  We split an entree--the jumbo sea scallop served with  gouda grits, pork belly brussels sprouts and corn purée (34 dollars). The scallops did smell a little fishy  so not the freshest but they were huuuge, cooked well and just  really buttery soft. The grits were amazing. Grits was thick almost like a polenta but so smooth and creamy and flavorful. We loved it! Mussels had  nduja sausage, fennel, leeks, bouillabaisse broth, grilled baguette (18 dollars),l. Wish there was more bread and wish there was more sausage. It was good but not great.  We asked for more bread but it never came (and we understood Mussels smelled fresh. We commented that we've had better mussels  other places that are served in a similar tomatoe broth cream sauce. Felt like the broth  didn't pack that flavor punch we were expecting especially since it had sausage.  

Creme brûlée (12 dollars) was good but wasn't a fan of the poached apples. Bread pudding (11 dollars) is my favorite dessert. Bread pudding was good but a bit overcooked. For me a perfect bread pudding has a  hard  crust but soft within that hard crust/ crispy brown edges. It was a bit thick / dense. Nonetheless I still enjoyed it, because even a bad bread pudding is still pretty decent.  I really liked the Terrapin Luau Passion Fruit-Orange-Guava IPA.",2/19/2020 22:32

I got the boss hog cooked medium rare and had them add an egg to it. On the side I got sweet potato fries and the 420 shake. The burger was unbelievable from presentation to consumption. Meat was cooked perfect, bun was soft and the size was just right. Massive onion rings, pork belly and a sunny side up egg al blended perfectly with the bbq sauce on there. The fries were great. I normally go for hand cut fries but that was not an option and I was surprisingly not disappointed with the sweet waffle fries.

blackened grouper.

So, if you haven't picked up by now, I obviously ordered the fish and chips. (What?!) jk I ordered the blackened grouper. OOH.. *whistle* it was so. Good. Perfectly seasoned, guys. I mean, perfectly. Not overly salty. Had some garlic and onion goin' on in there, maybe some paprika. And a tad bit of subtle sweetness that had my mouth wanting MORE. And such a decent amount! It was so good. Even the beans and rice were good! Tender rice with seasoned beans. Fresh pico de gallo. And this FISH oh Lord this fish.

So good. Let's just say....If I could only subsist on fish alone...and I also lived right next to Badfins Food + Brew...and I also had lots of money.

I would eat this. Every. Day. And get ALL the Omega 3's and 6's that this world has to offer!

fpiirm8MU_hSJBjHpbtIUA,4,"So, it looks like they're back open, but with a very limited menu.  They've got a re-opening special going, that's $5 (plus tax, cash only) where you get miso, and your choice of katsu (deep fried pork loin) and curry, karage (deep fried chicken) and curry, or just plain curry.

The miso that came out wasn't your standard tofu and seafood miso - this miso was packed with pieces of pork, carrots, yams, fish cake, etc.  I thought I took a picture, but apparently did not since it's not on my phone . . . whoops.

I got the katsu, which is hard to mess up - deep fried, lightly breaded with panko, and served on a bed of shredded cabbage with some tonkatsu sauce in a ramikin.  This came on a small, rectangle plate.

Curry came in a big bowl - white rice, and a generous service of curry on top and to the side.  No fancy presentation here - just a bowl with rice thrown in, and curry dished over it.  I don't know much about Japanese curry.  My only experience with it is that growing up, we probably had the S&B Golden Curry that you can find at most well-stocked groceries now at least once a month, and I still make it occasionally.  In any case, I liked it.  I'm used to having Japanese curry with the bright yellow, pickled daikon, and I know when I had the curry here before, they offered the pink, pickled daikon (and being Korean, we always had kimchi with it too).  In any case, none was offered, and I didn't think to ask.

I did ask if they were planning on going back to their full menu, and the woman working the front of the house said they were hoping to - I got the feeling she didn't know for sure or the timeline for a shift back to ramen is unknown, so she was dancing around the question a little.

Tonkatsu and curry are both close to comfort food for me - they're generally known quantities, and items we'd have at home growing up.  The food here reminded me of those simple meals at home.

Definitely hoping they get back into the ramen business, but even with just curry, I'll be returning.",4/11/2014 16:05
NNgQ8fV5ARQgHw-Ob7l50A,4,"Dear (South)Korea, 

You sure are looking smug these days.  Why is that?

Is it because of that sweet magic you puled off with Kim Yu-Na at the Olympics?

Is it your current World Cup team, who seems to blow up the facebook status updates of my friends every time they so much as sneeze?

Is it your liberal use of TADs in the field of Orthodontics and the crazy final results you get, nonsurgically?

It could be all of those things, but let's face it.  I know why you look so smug - you've won my stomach over.

It was a tough battle.  I know that little over a year ago, I tried an item called fish cake at a Korean restaurant.  I wasn't really impressed by it, but that is probably what I got for going in cold and ordering seemingly at random.  This experience put a damper in my appreciation of your cuisine for quite a while and for that I apologize.  I should not have been so foolish.

Over the many months, you'd spring up once in a while, throwing a bi bim bap or kimchee my way.  I had colleagues who would try to set us up at various restaurants and Korean associates would feed me some homemade items.  Even though I always liked you(especially your BBQ skills), I wasn't ready to let you get a secure foothold in my eating itinerary.  Life was just too complicated.  We were friends, but not the kind that called frequently to hang out.

After Koreana, something changed.  Things suddenly got serious.  My regular Thai and Japanese go-tos now had a serious competitor.  Places like H-Mart, Miga, and some-Korean-BBQ-place-I-Can't-Remember-The-Name-of paved the way, but Koreana sealed the deal and solidified my serious enthusiasm for Korean food.

Koreana did the following things really freaking well:
Dol sot bi bim bap - very tender beef, egg, and really fresh tasting veggies stirred all together with rice in a clay pot.  After you add the hot sauce to this, you will realize that you sit before something awesome.  If you don't like this hot sauce, you should apologize for your behavior to any friends you have remaining because you are probably an asshole.

Kimchi bokeum bop - Spicy fried rice dish with chopped kimchee and egg.  Really great.

Goon mandu - Fried pork and veggie dumplings.  They are good but comparable to dumpings that can be achieved at other Asian food restaurants.

Jaeyook dup bap - meat and veggies in a thicker, spicy sauce.  

Oh yeah, and the items were pretty darn cheap and pretty darn fast and their hot sauce...oh, be still my beating heart.  It was excellent.

So you see, (South)Korea, your cuisine will be getting many more of my dining dollars in the years to come.  It has been a long road, but one that I'm happy to have traveled.  

Sincerely,
Brad P.",6/19/2010 12:12

Constantly being the odd man out I tend to gravitate toward chill joints where locals hang to shoot the shit.  From day one in Ybor I found myself hanging out at the Tampa Bay Brewing Company.

For lunch I've done the inside part (AC is a beautiful thing while in business casual), but at night I hit the outside bar.  Surrounded by regulars, drunk stumblers and a parade of randomness, I thoroughly enjoy my time here.  

I've tried the porter, stout, blonde and red-eye and loved all of them.  The food also rocks socks with solid burgers (done perfectly medium rare) and wings that will blow out your colon (ask for the Hellfire sauce).

No matter where I wander in Ybor, I'm bound to end up at Tampa Bay Brewing.  Cool as hell bartenders and the kind of odd shit that only happens when you've hugged a bar stool for too long.

5kcLlhJPLJL_GLwrAdbZAA,2,"My drinks were great, but my food was quite bland. My friend Ken and I ordered the buttermilk fried persimmons, pork belly and root veggie empanadas, and coffee rubbed beer braised short rib. I expected the persimmons to be sweet, but they were devoid of any flavor, so much so that they tasted like turnips. Sadly, the accompanying marinated red peppers were the highlight of this dish. They actually had flavor. The empanadas were filled with pork belly, which is usually full of flavor, but was sadly lacking here. The root veggies made the filling even more bland. Now the piece de resistance... the short rib was fork tender, but the sauce was too bitter for its own good. The accompanying brown butter brussel sprouts were even more bitter. To taste two bitter components in the same dish doesn't work for me. I feel that this is where something like brown butter carrots would've balanced out the bitter sauce. There were carrots in the mashed potatoes, but not enough to balance the bitterness. I'm quite disappointed in the food. I think there is potential for this food to be amazing with the right spices and then we wouldn't need the salt and pepper shakers and bottle of hot sauce they brought over to our table.",10/21/2018 5:40

2YKkLFeOx-0zRcWp0KUv_Q,4,"A few visits in now, here's my rundown:

What I don't like:
The bar stools -  they are attached to the ground. If you're not normal sized (like me) sitting at the bar is VERY uncomfortable.

What I like:

The vibe -  cornhole, ping pong and other activities to entertain you while you partake of the beverage of your choice and hang with family or friends.
The service -  we've gotten our food fast and last time they forgot to sub my salad for the requested soup. They rectified it by giving me a cup of soup for free.  
The food - My wife and I ordered different burgers so we could split them and try both... the Pub and the M.A.C. The Pub burger was supposed to come with havarti, BBQ sauce and bacon... only they forgot the bacon. Huh? How does that happen? Once it was added it was a good burger. The M.A.C. is a shameless reincarnation of the same thing as that place with the golden arches... only CD's version is WAY better. My wife and I agreed if we go back, that's what it would be for.

What I love:

The pretzel bites with provolone fondue. . You have to be extremely careful not to fill up on these if you order them as an appetizer. I'm also pretty fond of the beer selection and drinks in general. Their cocktails are creative and tasty.

All in all, there's little to complain about here (except the bar stools). It'll definitely be someplace that stays on our radar when we're looking for someplace outside our usual rotation of places.",8/6/2018 16:45

I was refused purchase unless I could show proof of copy-right of the photos. 

I was trying to surprise a friend by decorating her apartment with photographs of her and her family.  I was given copies of these photographs to print.  There are only 2 cases here.  

1. The photographer was not a professional so, no copy-right receipt exists, thus making it impossible to convince this dim-witt employee that its legal for me to buy the photos.

 2.  The pictures were from a professional, but the photos were not proofs & they had no copy-right restriction printed on the photo.  And since my friend's family has other copies and prints of the photos they share at home and facebook, my guess in this case the copy-right has been purchased.

Ultimately, I shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable or be treated rudely when it comes to purchasing photos.  I was doing nothing wrong but trying to be thoughtful for a friend.  I was wrongfully accused of trying to commit a crime.

EbzIOck2feoZrGxRjyPDyw,4,"This place has a good vibe. It's my Irish pub of choice in Rittenhouse. Much more Irish-y than its neighbor, the Irish Pub. The latter isn't a bad choice in itself - I just prefer the Bards.

Anywhoo, it's your standard bar set in a Philly row. They have a good selection of local beers on their northernmost tap, and a kitschy whiskey dispensing tap mounted on the wall that looks like it was DIY'd, but with talent. They've also got your light beers on tap closer to the dart board, you pansy.

The food here is always changing. I've had a rotation of pub grub standards (chicken fingers, fries, etc) here, and between the breading changing, the fries being spiced/unspiced, and the curry being awesome/mediocre, the food averages out to 3/5. Tasty and satisfying enough to order, but nothing you should feel compelled to try.

Here's to the Bards staying chill.

Pro-tip: 3 dollar Yards pints at Happy Hour and late night (I think). Basically, every time I'm here (usually late night), Yards is almost always on special.

Bonus points: the jukebox has Michael Jackson's ""The Lady in My Life."" HUGE plus for me. The song doesn't really fit the mood of the place, but it's good to know it's an option if I want to feel pretty.",1/11/2011 15:41

Once I was acknowledged I paid for my food and left. 
I ordered the hibachi chicken and Shrimp along with noodles and rice. My mini and I split it and given it was fairly good size portions for a lunch plate. I truly never can decide between the noodles and the rice because they both are so delicious. We also received clear soup and salad with our meal. I didn't like that they kept both the soup and the salad on a cart by the register, so we didn't eat it.

You could tell there is some high level expertise and attention to details in how they craft their food offerings. Also, they've got a great selection of market goods. They've got kewpie mayo too!

5 stars - Chili oil. In the fridge they've got this chili oil that is soo good. The flavor profile is complex, it doesn't shy away from a nice spice level, and it has these fried onions in it that make it the perfect pairing to fresh steamed rice. And the chili oil is good on their bread too. 

5 stars - Bread bake. Their bread is exactly as described. When they call it a baguette it's the texture and crisp you expect. Any of their sourdough loafs are what you'd expect, a good chew and the air bubbles from a fermented dough. 

5 stars - Cookies. Their cookie flavor combos are so complementary. Depending on the cookie type, they can be crispy or chewy, so it really gives options to different type of cookie eaters. 

5 stars - Pastries. With the standard pastry options, they have different savory and sweet options too, and are unique from what you'd find elsewhere. I really appreciate that. Every time I go I can try something new. 

5 stars - Farmer's market. They can also be found at the Broad Ripple farmers market. Their goods sell out fast there, but it's nice that they go a little north so it's not too far of a drive for me to their downtown location.",12/13/2021 4:24

Then he hands me the phone, and she starts naming off things we didn't even ask for or wanted. The first order was a medium pizza with creamy garlic ranch sauce with chicken, bacon, and pineapple. She was literally stuck on the creamy garlic ranch part for over 3 mins. Kept saying different sauces that I DIDN'T WANT. Then I say with chicken, bacon, and pineapple.

I am pretty unfamiliar with Taiwanese cuisine but was lucky to have few Taiwanese friends in our group to explain the items on the menu. However, don't hesitate to ask the server questions since the menu doesn't have much detail. The servers are pretty friendly and are willing to help you figure out what you're craving. While the majority of the group ordered the beef noodle soup, I decided to order the stewed chicken which was incredibly delicious and definitely satisfied my cravings. The stewed chicken came in a stone pot accompanied with a bowl of rice. The chicken was steamy hot over the boiling wine/ginger sauce. One thing I wish I could change about the dish is making it a little easier to eat. I was picking at the mini bones in between bites.

Also noteworthy are the truffle fries w/Pecorino Romano and chicken parm sandwich. I'd love to try their dry rub wings, pizza, and other sandwiches. In fact, I'd really love to work my way through the menu. Check it out for yourself.

Some Yelpers and I came here after the Fit Club event because the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed for the day. We were here later (probably 730ish) and the place was pretty quiet. 

We ordered some drinks. Two of the four got beer, the other two split a bottle of wine. They don't have a huge wine list, but they have a few reds and whites, a small selection of domestic and foreign beers, and some standard cocktails. 

We ordered food, got the peppercorn fries to share. I had a few bites and they were pretty good. The gravy was rich and peppercorns added a nice bite. There is grated cheese on the dish, but it's not poutine because they're not cheese curds. I really appreciate the fact Blue Rare didn't try to falsely advertise this dish as poutine. 

I got the blackened chicken. It's a cajun spiced grilled chicken breast topped with a fruit salsa. The chicken was nice, a little spice but not unbearable and pretty moist (even with the blackened part it certainly wasn't burnt). The fruit salsa was good but there was hardly any on the chicken, it amounted to a few diced pineapple pieces on top. More salsa, even a small dish would have been nice. 

It comes with cooked veggies, which were the most random veggies, a cooked carrot, piece of grilled corn, one piece of steam broccoli and cauliflower.

However, this ended up being totally worth it. The decor was inviting, the bathrooms impeccable and the menu was awesome and well-explained.

I went with someone who doesn't enjoy curry (so we've never gotten to eat Indian food together); he was sort of set on disliking Indian cuisine. Raul came to the rescue. I ordered samosa as an app & it was divine; the veggies inside were more ground than I'm used to but right away I could tell the flavors were complex. It was almost like one could taste a lot of different flavors, but not all at once. 

Raul insisted we try the garlic naan (NOT a mistake) & made my co-diner a lamb dish that was off the menu (maybe a variation of the Vindaloo or the Patthar Gosht- I can't remember!), sans curry. 

I went with the Navratan Korma. It was mind-blowingly delicious and worth every penny. Yet again with my entree, the flavors and textures of the sweet fruits and veggies like cauliflower and the bits of almond revealed themselves in layers, with a bit of sumptuous heat remaining. Every bite was something to savor. 

In the end, there was enough for us to take home & reheat later, and Raul even told us how to ideally box it to take with us. My only request: more naan per serving! I'm used to naan coming with the dish, and being refillable, and I really would love it if they moved in that direction (hint hint guys- your naan is awesome!).

bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA,5,"First a cool history lesson (thank you Wikipedia) -

""Norman ""Sailor Jerry"" Collins (born 1911, died 1973) is considered the foremost American tattoo artist of his time. He expanded the array of colors available by developing his own safe pigments. He created needle formations that embedded pigment with much less trauma to the skin, and he was one of the first to utilize single-use needles and hospital-quality sterilization. His attention to detail was so precise that the riggings in his nautical tattoos were perfectly accurate. He regarded tattoos as the ultimate rebellion against ""the Squares"".""

And Now The Review -

This store was incredible when it was in Old City, and now that it's moved it's even bigger. Picture a cool fashion store where you can get clothing with designs that are based on one of the most legendary tattoo artists ever? it can be on the expensive side a lot of times, but think about how many clothing stores sell items that are cheap knock offs to tattoo art. This stuff is the real deal! they also sell cool buckles, glasses, zippos, and other merchandise. sometimes they have cool stuff in a sales rack.

Just looking to have fun, get a good workout and pick up some self defense along the way? Cool. There are a lot of us in that camp as well. Either way, the gym is super inviting and friendly to newcomers of all ages. 

The owner, Lane, is a down to Earth guy who has loads of knowledge and tons of stories from his fighting days. The fundamentals class is taught by John, a very humble and patient blackbelt. Both gentlemen are excellent teachers who want to see their students improve.",6/8/2019 19:43

Last time we went we got ""penang curry seafood fried rice"" and it was a huge portion, tons of seafood. Highly recommended. The curry reminded me of singapore style noodles. I asked the main flavor and the server was nice enough to share a few secrets! Broomall needs a place like this, they've done such wonderful work on the interior. The staff is so friendly and cheerful, quick to respond, everything. Nothing but good things to say. The lo mein is thinner than you might be used to, but the portion is HUGE and SO SO delicious! Any fried meat you get like sweet and sour chicken or general tso's is very crispy and freshly fried is clean clean oil.

First of all, this is one swanky place. We sat on the top level which was cool because the weather was nice and there was a nice breeze happening. AND IT WASN'T RAINING! 

The service was good. Our server was attentive but not in our face all the time. We started with the guacamole and it was not good. Being that we are from California we both agreed the guac was missing something. Lime or lemon, or salt or something. It kinda just tasted like straight avocados. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it was delicious. It was juicy and crisp and perfectly seasoned. Definitely will go and order that again.

I heard the woman on the phone ordering a Tom yum soup with chicken for pick-up, and the owner Peeta sounded like she knew exactly who it was and how she liked her soup prepared. I decided to order the same thing with shrimp, it came out to $15 for a large order and a 20 minute wait. No big deal, I'm getting my oil
Changed across the way. Got my soup, she said come back again to try everything else. 

Got back to the office and opened it up...holy smokes did I just find the best Tom yum soup I have ever had? I'm Asian (surprise!) , and I have had a lot of Tom yum soup in my time from San Francisco to San Diego. This was fire. I mean, fresh ginger? Fresh lemon grass? Fresh galingol ?!??!!!!!

When we got there, they asked us to come back so they could fix it. No, we can't, we just drove 5 hours to get here. It took hours for them to ""fix"" most things, but the toilet was still broken. They were going to ship us the part so we could get back on the road. On our walk through I asked why there was only one battery when there was a spot for two. They said they are only required to give us one battery. On our first trip, I'm driving down the road and the RV is SMOKING! We pull over and the guys in the shop had zip tied the positive and negative connectors to the FRAME because they were too cheap to give me a second battery. What did Camping world do after 15 calls and speaking to two managers?? NOTHING! They wanted me to take the RV back (another 10 hour round trip drive) to prove they did it, and I didn't.

We again received excellent service and had wonderful food!  Mr. Hoque waited on us.  As before we had great conversation with him.  He is very good at making food and wine suggestions.  I am vegan and he helped me navigate the menu.  I had the eggplant dish which was very good.  We also tried a bread we had not had before that had mint in it.  Also delicious.  My husband had a lamb dish that looked to have spinach in it.  He seemed to enjoy it very much.  For an appetizer I had the potato pakora.  My better half had the meat samosa.  If memory serves, the wine that was suggested was a malbec wine and went perfectly with our dinner.  We had plenty of food left over to take home, but I admit I wish we had ordered more to take with us just because I missed the food so much once it was gone.  =)  

The food at Saffron is a little different than other Indian restaurants I have been to, but I have never been to two that were exactly alike.  The owner is from Bangladesh which makes the food more unique than the others in which I have dined.  Saffron is definitely one of my/our very favorite restaurants!  We will have to order extra food next time so that we can have our favorites as well as try some of the things on the menu we have never had before.  I would like to try some things from the Indo-Chinese section.  I would also love to try their lunch buffet sometime if I ever wake up early enough to go.  =)

HwL0cUMC7-qghiAKBzMpXg,4,"Going to The Barnes Foundation BEFORE they allowed you to take photos and AFTER was as different as night and day. 
I previously held off reviewing The Barnes as a museum because of the really bizarre experience I'd had
Seriously, the guards were all over us the last time I was there and not being able to take photos (for fun, or for reference) really detracted from our visit (along with their crappy solution for conveying information about the pieces in each room.) 

Fast-forward to my most recent jaunt, when I specifically when to see a special exhibit when I realized that the photography ban was lifted and that not only were there more people, but there were more people talking, taking pictures, looking at the reference materials and looking like they were enjoying themselves. 

The lack of information to the visitor is still a major problem for me. I like what I like, so I don't really love guided tours in museums - but I want to know what I'm looking at (hence the 4 stars) particularly due to the nature of the Barnes collection. 
The only reference for any of the art is available solely on these laminated cards stored inside the benches in each room. And they copied the original layouts of the room and Barnes wall ensembles, so there'll never be any real 'signage' but you need to do better.  
Either create the world's most robust app (current app - very meh) to remain unobtrusive so people know what they're looking at, OR print a robust, worthwhile museum guide for visitors to carry on their journey and take home with them. 

Because (confusion aside) the collection itself is very cool. 
Pieces aren't here because they're works by famous artists -- they're here because of what Barnes himself saw in each piece. The man had boots on the ground in Europe, seeking out art himself, and amassed the collection on his own. Other museums existed during this time but no one else had someone there like Barnes himself was, learning more about the art, tracking pieces down and really seeing the value in some of the most popular styles of art now before anyone else did.

More helpful details: There is coat & bag check in the basement (as well as lockers) along with a small but decent gift shop. The bathrooms were a bit of a hot mess both times I was there which, should be something they might want to look into dealing with.",11/9/2018 19:59

ZDCWEctaQHfJQT1sH_rMmA,3,"We hired Sierra to redesign and re-landscape our yards which were hit hard by the drought. They had great ideas, but the execution as a whole fell short due to a pattern of inconsistency. 

My parents have a tract home with an average-sized yard for Goleta. We needed the bulk of the existing landscape demo'd, with the exception of a few trees and hardscape items. When Jose came to provide an initial estimate, we found him to be a friendly guy and were excited over the idea of our yards being transformed into the oasis we'd long envisioned. Seven months later, this three-month job is still under construction. 

We appreciated how the work was billed in tiers. Rather than paying the full amount all at once, my parents would pay a bit at a time for the portion of work done. On that note, Sierra's bid was less expensive than some other landscapers we'd interviewed, which we also enjoyed. 

As evidenced by the photos, Sierra delivered quality craftsmanship. The plants and lawn are coming in beautifully, the landscape lighting looks gorgeous at night, and the raised planter beds are just what we wanted.

However, much of the initial momentum waned after month two or so. There would be weeks at a time with no work done - we did have a rain storm early on in 2019, but the timing on this didn't exceed three weeks. We were informed that there were several other current jobs on Sierra's pipeline, and never really felt like our project was a priority for them. It was a matter of my dad prodding Sierra to follow through with the procedure. For instance, when the lawn was installed, there was a two month delay before the irrigation was even operable - and now, some of the sprinklers are spraying hard water directly onto the brand new back bedroom windows. The fencing was constructed, but there was a four month gap until the gates were working. There was a good amount of cutting corners, here - I could go on but I'm sure you get the gist. 

Sierra began working on the yard in November of 2018. It is now May of 2019 and per my dad, it is about 90% complete. As I am writing this on my parents' behalf, they have stated that they likely would not recommend Sierra to others. I may modify the review if they come and complete the work (it has been two weeks since we've last seen them), but for now, three stars it is.",5/18/2019 19:04

Such was our experience here when we had a ""team"" of four waitstaff (gender neutral might I point out) belaboring about our table. For the record that was a ""one-to-one"" relationship of service staff to patron which proved to be overwhelming.
It might have gone better. No wait. It WOULD have gone better had they been orchestrated better and had specific assignments. Maybe in reality they did, but it sure didn't seem like it. No sooner had we told one that ""no we don't need anything else"" when the next one would turn up and ask ""is there anything else we can get for you?"".
Don't get me wrong, I'm very well seasoned with experiencing professional wait service but this was out of hand.
I loved the more common attention to detail, like the dark cloth napkins set upon dark clothing and white cloth napkins set upon lighter clothing and the refilling of beverages and the removal of unwarranted service items like the extra fork or spoon you didn't need but the hovering was mind blowing.

I've never climbed as I'm always the only adult with my boys but it's usually 50/50 split between adults and beginners climbing, all abilities. No need to be bashful of you're a beginner here. Laid back atmosphere. They give you a brief tutorial after they get you in the harness each time you come. They also offer lessons and other group and instructor led activities. There is also an opportunity to join and become a member/frequent climber that has perks, see their website for info.

From the stainless steel appliances, to the granite countertops, and the huge bay windows; the Raleigh is hands down the nicest apartment I have lived in. 

The location is convenient as well. It's on the north side of downtown, so you have to walk or drive a mile or so to get to most of the downtown attractions, but it was also nice to be a little bit away from all of the noise and traffic that comes with living downtown. We moved out after a year, due to our rent increasing almost $100 a month, which is the only bad thing I have to say about Circle City Apartments. We would've stayed if we could've afforded to, but it was already at the top of our rent budget when we moved in, so it just made sense for us to move to a more affordable place outside of downtown. However, the rent is actually very reasonable for those that can afford to pay premium prices to live downtown, and priced much better than some of the newer, luxury apartments downtown.

I appreciate that when I asked for well-done, my burger was indeed well-done. That was pretty good, considering a lot of places don't understand my desire for ""no pink."" I got the Whiskey River BBQ without mayo (public service announcement: mayo is gross) and loved it. Delicious! The buns are to die for. They really impressed me. 

Also at the table was a Prime Chophouse that looked appetizing. Glancing over the menu, there are several different burgers that I'd love to try. I mean... there is a Bonzai burger (Hawaiian theme?) and the Blue Cheese burger, both of which look like they're amazing (I saw a Blue burger at a nearby table and salivated a little). 

Great service, even though they'd just opened and the place was slammed. They have TVs for football if you're into that. I think it makes the place too loud, and it is hard to have a quiet (well...any) conversation. But if you're there for food and not an intimate date you'll enjoy the burgers.",9/12/2018 20:19

6C8Ne6yRu6TzBLbhfhdduw,3,"tl;dr despite its gorgeous location and well-executed set-up, expect a menu of overpriced and underwhelming cafe fare

This all-day cafe, run by Top Chef champion Nick Elmi, was one of the hottest openings of the year. The Landing Kitchen is built into the ground floor of the Bala Cynwyd Residence Inn, itself an homage to the Pencoyd Ironworks foundry. Industrial accents including exposed beams, garage-doors style windows, and converted metalwork highlight the atmosphere. The spacious patio hosts plenty of marble tables, complete with umbrellas and heat lamps to accommodate any weather. If you're lucky, you can grab a seat at one of the sophisticated lawn chairs, arranged around the large gas firepit. The riverside location offers uncharacteristically stunning snapshots of the Schuylkill (one-upped only by the views from the Pencoyd footbridge, only a stone's throw away). Order at the counter, then take a number to your table.

We arrived mid-morning for Sunday brunch to a moderately sized line. Despite the hordes of staff members, most seemed either distracted or clueless. The line nearly stretched out the door by the time we ordered.

My partner and I split The Ironworker and the Landing Breakfast Sandwich. Both sandos were moderately sized, and both would have immensely benefited from a more exciting bun. For the former, the richness of the pork roll and Cooper sharp pleasantly contrasted the sweet tomato spread; however, the potato roll felt flimsy. For the latter, the maple sausage / salsa verde combo sported a nice zing of flavor, but the shoe-like English muffin was dull and forgettable. The table also shared an order of BBQ Fries, which could not have a more misleading name -- they were limp steakhouse fries, unevenly seasoned and served with Heinz ketchup packets. The coffees ranged from standard to underwhelming; flavor shots in the iced coffees were decidedly flavorless, despite an associated upcharge.

The bill sat at nearly $20 a head (after tax and tip). While the sandwiches were a step above fast-food breakfast sandos, the premium on them feels borderline criminal. While the Landing Kitchen is worth a visit at least once to appreciate the scenery, don't hold your breath for a dining experience to match.",10/18/2021 16:17
jc8xUrNwZRgXMSLr_qzAcA,5,"FINALLY Nashville gets a real Korean BBQ place. Well, Brentwood but close enough...and I didn't actually try the BBQ yet but it looks legit. The tables with grills are on the right side of the restaurant. If you just want the regular menu, you sit to the left. I went for lunch and was in the mood for some soup. Korean soup (or jjigae) is the best soup you will ever have. I used to live in Korea and would eat it almost every day when the weather was cold. Or hot. Or the next morning after a rough night. Ok, so it's always good (wiping off drool and getting back to my review). Sitting in the booth, it was pointed out to me that the table had a call button. This is what every restaurant in Korea has. If you need something, press the button. It might seem rude but it's actually pretty convenient. The menu has a mix of Japanese and Korean items. I didn't pay much attention to the sushi and focused on the Korean dishes. I was excited to see some great ""appetizers"" like tteokboki and pajeon. I knew I couldn't eat these plus a soup for lunch but I really want to go back for dinner and get some tteokboki. I knew right away what I wanted. Yukgaejang is my favorite Korean food. It's a spicy broth with shredded beef, egg, bean sprouts, glass noodles, and bracken (? I think this is the translation in English). If you've never had this, order it. It's life changing. I have had this at other  Korean restaurants in America and it has been a bit oily or just way too spicy (which it's supposed to be so that's fine). However, this one was perfect. It was spicy enough without killing me, it wasn't oily, and it had just the right amount of all the ingredients. This is the best bowl of yukgaejang I have had since coming back from Korea. The ban chan were also delicious and plentiful. My favorite dish is the cucumbers with the gochujang. Since it was lunch, I just had a Coke, but they have great prices on beer. They also have soju if you want to drink like a true Korean. Overall, this place is pretty authentic and seems to have all of my Korean favorites. I will be able to come here and fulfill all of my Korean cravings!",10/16/2018 18:47

It took  around 30 minutes to get our check. 

The food presentation was good but way overpriced. The ""smash burger"" is not a smash burger, thick patty more like a steak burger? It was good flavor but just not what the menu said by any stretch. Also didn't have the normal smash burger flavor of being cooked in mustard.

The ravioli came with a marinara sauce that was unbelievable. We order drinks to start the night off right. I had their famous whiskey and cola..well I had a couple of them. This cocktail was made with a st Elmo whiskey which had hints of cherry in it. They were so good!!! Great dishes to try if you love seafood like I do is the scallops with couscous. My fiancé had the filet which was super tender. For sides we had fried green tomatoes, creamed spinach, and mash potatoes. Everything was great even the service. Our server Sarah was very attentive.

__lBqInsieAkCXmrPSMguA,3,"Come here early if you want to be able to pick from the entire menu! I think I would have had a much better experience if I'd been able to have my first or second choice meal. The Mug is farm to table, which means that their ingredients come in limited quantities so once they run out, they're out! Head over early to ensure that you can have your pick of everything they have to offer. 

I had the sloppy joe because they were completely out of chicken when I went. The meat was what you'd expect from a sloppy joe but the bun was just a general grocery store bun. I decided to go for the garlic fries, but found them to be a huge letdown. Instead of the fries being tossed with fresh garlic or granulated garlic and any other seasonings, they just added chopped garlic to the top of regular, non-seasoned fries. I've heard the sweet potato fries are good, so maybe go with those instead. We wanted to try their mac and cheese, but they were also out of that when we went. On the plus side, their root beer is delicious! Someone in my party said the pork tenderloin was very tasty, so go for it if you're interested.

They have a nice covered patio and allow pets to sit there while you eat, so that's a huge plus especially when the weather is nice. Overall, just make sure to head over early if you want to be able to choose from the entire menu!",9/29/2019 2:32

My husband had the beef cheeks which literally melted in your mouth and had the most amazing flavor. I had the Flounder special served over a sweet potato and sausage hash set on top of pesto sauce.

tHVFAI0kemjV8Il9UjXBrw,4,"I go to Hung Vuong at least once a week for most Asian groceries. The prices just can't be beaten here. Seriously. Plus, Hung Vuong is a lot bigger than Hmart (the other nearby Asian grocery store), so they consistently carry the most exotic produce and imported shelf items in this area.

Although if you see something you like, stock up because there's no guarantee it will ever be back in stock again. This has happened to me with some of my favorite items in the past (a certain brand of Thai coconut milk and a brand of Filipino cookies).

However, you should be aware of one thing with Hung Vuong's low prices. Some produce could be on the verge of going bad or shelf items slightly past the expiration date. Not everything is like that, but sometimes there are many more than I would expect. So, inspect your fruits and check your dates on items you buy to be on the safe side.

TIP: Be sure to sign up for their rewards program, available at the customer service area. That way, you can get a few bucks off once you spend a certain amount.",1/10/2022 2:22
s6CB8sohXlCL6XZDgAy3SA,1,"I think Basic 4 was one of the most disappointing veg restaurant experiences I've ever had. I ordered the ""Carrot Tuna"", which a previous user raved about on another site, VegGuide.org. That user only had one review so I can't help but wonder if he/she is an employee/owner of Basic 4 and posted this false review to boost business.

I've had tofu, seitan, and chickpea-based ""tuna"" and they've all been good. Some use dulse/seaweed to give it a ""fishy"" taste, some use chopped celery to give it better texture, and all use some sort of vegan mayo. Basic 4's ""carrot tuna"" uses none and they don't add anything else to give it interesting flavor or texture. The sandwich was literally carrots on a pita. The pate appeared to be pure carrots pulverized in a food processor, with a little onion and maybe salt and lemon juice. How on earth is this supposed to resemble tuna? The plain carrot mixture was scooped into a pita bread with lettuce, onions, and tomatoes - no protein, and no mayo or sauce. It was the most boring sandwich I've ever had and a total waste of $6. I couldn't bring myself to finish it, so I took half of it home, added a veggie burger, some Veganaise and Siracha, and called it a day.

I also ordered the cream of broccoli soup for about $5, which turned out to be very bland. I'm glad they offered a vegan cream soup, as much of their menu isn't vegan (it looks like some of the soy meats they use contain milk), but it tasted like the stereotypical vegan soup that you would NOT want your non-vegan friends to taste. There was no robust flavor so instead of using rich vegetable broth, soy cream, and vegan butter, I think they just used water and thickened it with flour. No good.",12/10/2011 18:53

I enjoy the South Philly location a LITTLE more because each time I have been there - it's been way less crowded than the location on Sansom ever has been (Sansom location gets a LOT of traffic).  

The pizza at slice is really very good.  The crust is thin - the cheese is great - and there is NO grease.  I mean NONE.  Which I can seriously appreciate.  Additionally, they have a variety of cheese and dough options - which is great for people who are vegan, lactose intolerant, or are watching their weight.  The sauces taste good, and they always have an interesting combo of toppings / variety of pizza's that are great.  

The ambiance is simple, the service is good - the people are really friendly, but beware - they take only cash.

Of course, ALL of the BBQ items are top notch. Blue Oak, in my opinion, is the city's best BBQ joint. They've mastered the rub, sauces, and most importantly, smoking and cooking techniques. Fantastic bark on the brisket, perfect texture and flavor on the ribs, and just the right tang in the sauces. 

Outside of the ribs and brisket, my favorite item has to be the smoked chicken wings... they are FANTASTIC and without a doubt, some of the best around. Blue Oak perfectly crisps and then smokes the wings, adding a light buffalo sauce at the end. 

Flight of beers....... also good. Why get one beer, when you can get 5 small beers?

zPPNyikI-w9w9v66aXIikw,5,"How could you not give Carusos a five star review? The food is good, service was impeccable and the dining clearly is in the realm of experiential and fine. 

If the comparison is any other place in Santa Barbara- it's safe to say you won't be disappointed. The dining experience at Carusos truly is a Michelin worthy experience and one that should be indulged in for a very special occasion. 

I was invited to dinner at Carusos October 2021. At this time the restaurant was doing dinner service with a prefix menu. There was an an Amuse Bouche, a starter, a main plate, and of course dessert for $180 per person. Well the price tag may seem stark, a seasoned fine dinner enthusiast will quickly understand the caliber of experience is well worth it, and the novice can't deny that nothing beats the view of the sun setting over Miramar Beach as you're having dinner. 

Although both our Cacio e Pepe and Steak were perfectly prepared, I was interested Chef Massimo Falsini's more creative dishes! Some unique touches like fresh chimichurri sauce on the steak a surprise, and genuinely made the dish go from perfect (boring but good) to memorable. The most pleasing thing for me was the the grilled octopus as a starter with a base of  mole ( I believe?) sauce. The Octopus was chard on the outside with a slight crisp and soft and tender in the inside. Sweet and savory sauce underneath was a perfect compliment, and it's rustic flavor lingered on the palate. The dish is clearly inspired by Latin flavor and did well to pay homage to our cultural heritage in SB. Highly recommend this and hope the chef continues to keep us feeling a sense of discovery in his food over the usual aim of classism and consistency. If he keep up the creativity I could see Caruso's becoming a place I revisit again and again. 

As a wine enthusiast, I naturally brought wine from my own stash; my favorite Napa Valley table wine Overture by Opus One. The wine was juicy and velvety with enough structure to pair with the steak but not to overpowering for the octopus. . That being said there was a sommelier available.

The cocktail we each started with was was a great idea! Believe it or not, I'd took the mock tail which was inspired by Earl Grey tea and absolutely delicious. I would definitely order this again. My date ordered a dirty martini, and it was standard- just how we wanted it! 

All in all, everything was delicious but what really left an impression was the flavor of the food accompanied by that dreamy pink and purple sunset over the water. I highly recommend booking a table outside on the patio for sunset.",12/17/2021 5:13

I asked what the fish was and she said tilapia, which I won't eat, as it's farmed raised, unsustainably produced fish from Asia, and I told her so. She said they had catfish and they would make me some, which was a nice offer, but my partner had already ordered  from another restaurant and I didn't want to wait, so I had the fried chicken fingers. The chicken was dry and over cooked, and the sides were not seasoned well, so I'd skip this place if I ate at the food court again.

For the quality, they sure bring the food out pretty quick. Also, the burgers are not perfectly shaped discs. (Which is a pet peeve of mine). By default, they are cooked medium well, which, I believe, should be the standard. The patties themselves are decadent, tender, flavorful and charred to perfection.  Bubba's has officially raised the bar for ""$10 burgers"".  
     So the food is outstanding but the service matches it as well. Our server was attentive but not hovering.  My beer was cold and my food was hot and my service came with a smile.  And I love all the TV's!  Why would this place get anything lower than 5 stars??!!! C'mon! This place is heavenly!!",12/22/2018 0:31
V_feMM9_OQmqOJNz8oSlVg,2,"Stopped in for dinner with a group on a Friday. The restaurant is gorgeous, harkening back to the old days of getting dressed up to go to dinner (though the dress code has undoubtedly relaxed since the place opened).

We chatted with the sommelier, who was knowledgeable and helpful. We enjoyed a few great bottles of wine, the highlight of our evening. Our server, Jarrod, was also fun, bantering with us during our meal. 

We had a couple of appetizers -- the escargot and a seafood smorgasbord that included bbq shrimp and oysters. What was odd here was that the plating included the escargot on the plate with other items despite being ordered separately. This isn't a huge deal, but also made the appetizers less appetizing to one in our group who is not a fan of escargot. It was also odd in light of the bbq shrimp already being plated separately. 

I enjoyed the vichyssoise, and others had and enjoyed the caprese salad. The entrees, however, were truly disappointing. A few of us partook in the coolinary menu. The filets lacked salt. It was absolutely bland and disappointing. Nothing in the dish truly popped in terms of flavor. My husband had the fish which did have a tasty sauce but wasn't quite a home run. Another in our party ordered an a la carte fish entree and stopped eating after a couple of bites. It was clearly and tangibly an off night for the kitchen. 

Two other things were exceptionally frustrating. First, when a back dining room emptied out, someone was in there vacuuming while the door to the room closest to our table remained wide open. This lasted at least 25 minutes before the door was closed, but the person vacuuming must've been aiming for a Guinness record as they then vacuumed for over an hour. (The room isn't large enough to warrant that, but maybe that's how they earn employee of the month?)

Finally, the biggest upset was how restaurant employees actively avoided reminding patrons to wear their masks as they walked around. While I saw all employees wearing masks appropriately, it felt like a slap in the face to see them engage and banter with customers who were walking around the dining room without a mask. The restaurant needs to adhere strictly to state and local guidance which demands masks be worn inside. I understand that many employees may be tired of arguing with guests over this, but the safety of all trumps any semblance of discomfort for them. 

All in all, an off night. I expected a lot more from an iconic restaurant like Dickie Brennan's, but they absolutely missed the mark. I am disappointed, and certainly recommend going elsewhere, especially for a true quality upscale dining experience.",8/7/2021 16:01
RKPkxOYQlM0BjhM-H6_vAw,4,"This is like the capital grille of seafood establishments.   Very good for the crowd who enjoy good food with fancy digs but does not reach foodie level.  

A few notes: 
- you have to crash through all the plebes on bourbon street to get to the establishment
- the maître'd and servers are very pleasant if not terribly sophisticated
- food is plopped down on the table without explanation.  
- very much a steakhouse vibe though of course the focus is on fish selection.  This is evidenced by the branding on the plates and large font menus ;)
- daily menu so changes with whatever is fresh 
- flexible preparations.  You can have the fish cooked to your liking and can mix the sides if you're not feeling rice for instance (ie good for paleo heads)
- lively environment on the loud side
- can go healthy or full on decadent depending on your pleasure 

I hope that's helpful!   New Orleans has a plethora of great restaurants and gw fins fits the bill if not quite the most forward thinking of the crowd (not necessarily a bad thing).   If you wear raw denim opt for peche, if you are wearing a suit and comfortably large trousers go to gw fins",10/17/2014 0:43

And at Trader Joes you can always find samples.  The lady who normally works the sample area at this location is awesome (I cant remember her name)!  She gives lots of great ideas.  I have found that they have their cheeses open in the back so if you want to try what something tastes like ask the sample lady and if you are nice she will make it happen.
The sushi here is not bad considering it is pre packaged.  I find the Lobster Roll to be the best kind here.  The Lobster Bisque is pretty yummy as well.  The wine selection is nice however I am not a huge drinker so I can't talk much about that. I am in love with their orange chicken.  It is so simple to make and tastes very good!  It is my go to meal when I don't have time to make food myself.

The good:  the service was awesome.  Prompt, pleasant, speedy. The hatch mayo was delicious.  I didn't want to stop eating it with the fries.  
The mediocre:  the burger was ok but kind of small and dry for the price.  My friend and I shared a burger thinking they'd be a good size and fill us up.  These are not good for sharing.  
The bad:  the fries were either over crisp or soggy...how the heck does that happen!!  The reason I continued eating them was due to the hatch mayo.

LQJ7jEWxBBLYiaGVWdN5Dg,4,"Renown South Meadows Medical Center is the last place I ever really want to be.   Sadly, I'm there often - to the ER, to the surgery center and even a few times to visit people admitted to the hospital. 

All-in-all a nice clean hospital.  Friendly staff.  Tons of parking.  A security systems that still makes me scratch a my head.  I'm used to showing my id and getting a colored hall pass to gain access to a certain area of a hospital.  Here you just read the reader boards and head to where you want to be.   

My most recent visit to the Renown was to the surgery center.   Everyone was very nice save one RN - not worth the details but if you can't be nice dealing with people going in for surgery perhaps you need a sick day!   

I'm still not sure why we were told to arrive @530am for a 9am surgery.   Yes she was taken in early but we could've arrive at 630am and still spent an 1 1/2 hours in the waiting room. 

The procedure was over quickly.  Kudos to the staff for helping me get mom in the car.  After the discharge paperwork was done.  They told me to get my car and meet them at the ER entrance.  I was allowed to park right in front and they wheeled her to the car and helped get her settled.

4ubBKMNRphEtRWX4sZ4b1w,4,"I came here with a group of friends on a Sunday night. Luckily we made reservations because it was very crowded. The place has a nice classy yet casual feel to it. We were immediately greeted by our server, who was very personable. 

My friend and I decided to split the Marcos combo deal. It comes with 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, and 2 more entrees to take home! It was only about $45. It was such a great deal I couldn't pass it up! 

We ordered the mozzarella squares as our app. It comes with four huge squares of fried mozz. I wished there was a bit more sauce but other than that it was very good. I could only eat one square before starting to get full. 

For my entree, I ordered the four cheese ravioli. I honestly was not blown away by it. It was not bad, but was not as good as I was expecting. It could have definitely used some more red sauce. 

I became full quickly and it was time to order dessert. We decided on the brownie and I'm glad we did! It was huge, warm, and so tasty. 

At the end of the day, I went home with enough left overs to feed a small village. Overall, I had a nice experience at Maggiano's. It was not as high quality food as I expected, as it reminded me of a better version of Olive Garden.

Been here more than a few times- with or without an appointment and staff are friendly and accommodating. I have been to quite a few places but for me - this is the one. They are busy but still take their time with each customer and are meticulous. I usually try to go to Leo who has been there for more than 10 years - but I have had no issues with anyone else either. If you like one person and want to keep consistency- I'd book them in advance. There's no time I have found which is not busy so expect to wait if you don't have an appoint. If your waiting and wish to come back there's fast food and coffee in the same complex and your 5 min away from South Common. I have schellac and it has lasted me for some time - reasonable priced they offer other services like waxing. There's a small sitting area in the front and one communal bathroom in the back. Fairly clean. They don't accept credit so make sure you either have cash or debit on hand. They do have an atm machine inside their salon just in case you forget. If you do have an issue with your nails - I have seen them try to accommodate corrections. They have tv screens everywhere but they do chat and are very friendly.

V-jiTqYCFl0Tdxg8cmx1NQ,5,"I have updated my review based upon my final results. I found this place on Groupon, and I searched their social media posts and explored their website plenty of times before deciding to give them a try. I was interested in getting my lips touched up, in order to achieve symmetric fullness but in an attempt to avoid the fake, deflated tire look. Previously, I had damaged nerve on the lower corner of my lips, and I mainly seek to have the side with the damaged nerve look symmetric to the normal side.

Their base prices are probably some of the better prices I've seen in the area. The doctor does the fillers himself, although he does apparently have one PA that does some of the fillers too.

I was fortunate that they were able to get me an appointment on the day I called. When I was brought into the room, my lips were numbed before I even spoke to the doctor. When the doctor came in with the syringe, he briefly asked what kind of look I was going for and started right away.

I understand that it wasn't my first time getting this done, but it was my second, and I'm new to this place and by no means a pro. He was already injecting by the time I had the chance to ask, ""What's in the syringe?"" since the deal said ""Juvederm ultra or ultra plus."" I thought the ""or"" implied I'd get a choice. There was some bruising, which is normal.

I think it's nice, however, that he saved a little bit in the syringe so that when the swelling goes down, if there's anything that needs to be fixed, I don't have to buy a whole new syringe just to touch up a small area.

While I wasn't blown away by my experience here, I am thrilled with the results that I received. I would definitely trust my lips again with Dr. Pinto.",4/2/2019 15:10

kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA,4,"My friend and I made last minute plans to go to Cuba Libre for happy hour on a weeknight. Honestly, I wasn't planning to make a full meal out of our happy hour outing, but that completely changed after glancing around at the dishes our neighbors at the bar were getting. Everything looked so delicious!

First off, you are required to sit at the bar if you plan to order off of their happy hour menu. Ideally, we would have loved to sit at a table, but the bar ended up being just fine. The bartender was nice and friendly, although the service was pretty slow (more on that later).

We first started off with a glass of red sangria which might have been some of the best sangria I've ever had. It was very fruity and sweet but definitely packed a punch. My original plan was to call it a night after just one drink, but it was so good that I ended up getting a second. My friend got a white sangria for her second round and said the red was far better than the white.

As for food, we indulged in a variety of different small plates including Shrimp Cóctel, Pineapple Guacamole Cubano, a Churrasco Slider, Chicken Croquetas, and a few empanadas. All were really great but my personal favorites were the empanadas and the guacamole! The pulled pork empanada that I had was extremely flavorful, fried to perfection, and served with some kind of dipping sauce that I loved. It was quite filling as well! The guacamole was fresh and had chunks of pineapple which offered a sweet taste to this normally savory dish. They were served with plantain chips which I really enjoyed. The plantain chips weren't nearly as crisp as a tortilla chip would be, but I really liked them nonetheless. The presentation was also superb. 

The small plates are only $5 during happy hour which is an awesome deal. If you want to try a bunch of different things, I would encourage you to get the sampler. The sampler allows you to choose any seven small plates for just $31. That's what we did and it was a really good decision. I left completely stuffed and I was able to make this my dinner for the night!

As for the service, although it started off well, it was on a downward slope as the night went on. As happy hour came to a close, the bartenders became less attentive and we had to flag someone down numerous times for water refills and our check. Our corner of the bar was filled with dirty plates and our first round of empty drinks.

Still, I was very content with my overall happy hour experience. In fact, my friend and I have already talked about returning! The specials were great, the food and drinks were solid, and the prices were very reasonable. Hopefully everything stays up to par next time and maybe there will even be some improvement in service!",10/3/2018 2:49

I told the ""service department manager"" that the only thing going smooth since we have purchased this VW is that the payments are being taken every month!! Ive had parts replaced , needed to be ordered , back ordered on a 2021 atlas . 

Some would like to say ' did i take covid into consideration'? But thats a pretty easy way out if you ask me .

They also have Cafe du Monde coffee which is a New Orleans staple. 

The only downside is that the service is not the best, the restaurant is a quick serve so you order your food and drinks at the register. The food is delivered to your table in no particular order and not necessarily all together. The servers just bring the food the fountain drinks are self serve.

After paying over $4000 in vet bills, I was left with absolutely no answers. That is, until a necropsy was performed. After this heartbreaking experience, I will not be returning and hope nothing like this happens to others.",10/31/2020 17:58

Mine was missing some of the ingredients that the description explained. The waitress was the worst. Saw my my wife didn't eat her meal and just said box?  Then the hostess brought over the box and our check and said pay up front. Never asked for dessert. Told the hostess then a third girl brought dessert. THEN the waitress finally asked if everything was ok. I asked for the check, go to pay for meatloaf meal, prime rib sandwich, 2 soups, didn't realize until later one should of been an up charge, 2 sodas and 2 puddings $71.00 at a diner.

I started with a ginger phosphate. If you like real ginger, this drink is a delight. The tartness, the real ginger flavor, and the sweetness were near perfect harmony. Move over iced tea, you've got competition now.

Next up: the Farm Burger. I only eat burgers a few times a year, so I went big. Local ham, egg, and bacon topping the beef patty made it great. The beef was high quality, the bun delightful. I think the beef might actually exceed the quality of Burger Up, especially for the price. I balanced the Farm Burger with some sweet potato fries. Around the table, plates were mostly cleaned.

Despite the large group, we had excellent service who handled the half international crowd and a few late additions to the group with grace and efficiency. It was a little comical though when an over 60 year old European got carded for his beer.",12/7/2014 1:33

At the time of her death the senior staff were very apologetic but now they are totally ignoring us.  They first turned us over to their legal department and started a year long process of setting up discussion times and then ignored them.  Now they have hired outside council to continue ignoring us.
What amazes me is that this hospital professes it's Christian Caring Nature in everything that they do but the reality is that they do not.
Our story is not unique.  they've done it to other people in the past and they continue doing it to others.

Adesso Is located or the second floor of a lovely old building on Walnut  Street. The club is very large with lotsa comfortable seating to enjoy a good cigar.

At this point, I must have tried 2 different burgers, 2 different sandwiches, and at least one wrap, if not two. All of them...eh. Not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but far from the best.

Speaking of breakfast or lunch, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  But my favorite is always the chef's choice -- Plato Poca Cosa.  A surprise selection of three entrees...usually anchored by a tamale + two random choices.  Rice, beans, chips, tortillas and salad come with, too.

The kati wrap was really well done, it didn't break and wasn't chewy or tough. They made the wrap right away, there was almost no waiting and it was really cheap! I hate paying a ton for fancy Indian food because most of the time the recipes come from regions where the people who cook the recipes live on very little income. The tastes in this wrap were comparable to some of the best Indian food I've tried. I think this is a chain, if it is I haven't tried any other locations. They have seating inside and outside. It is a quick service restaurant where the employees are always behind the counter and you pick the food up from the counter. There is a case of bottled and canned drinks. The white sauce is not a garlic sauce, it tastes more like ranch, it did not fit on my sandwich, so I didn't use it. Overall I'll definitely be back when I'm craving Indian!

Upon arrival, we were greeted and sat immediately. We started with a carafe of Peach Bellini, which was great. We ordered The Oreo French Toast, Apple Pie French toast and Pecan French toast, along with Shrimp and Grits. Now, I had to send the shrimp and grits back, because they weren't hot. They also only put five shrimp in the entire dish, and I expected a few more. After sending the shrimp and grits back, I decided to order the Red Velvet pancakes, which took a long time to come because they are made to order. By the time they came, my friends were already finished eating! The Red Velvet Pancakes were hot and huge, but definitely lacked flavor-- like it tasted like some plain batter, that's it! 

Let's get into the French Toast... The French toast was absolutely AMAZING!!! Each one we ordered was packed with flavor! The Oreo was my absolute favorite! It was made with Challah bread, and had Oreo stuffed inside. Talk about a foodgasim!!! If you come here, you MUST try the FRENCH TOAST! It's probably legit the best French toast I've had.

Had a great guide - Evangelina - and be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes.  The streets are bumpy, sidewalks uneven and tho I didn't count the blocks, seemed like a lot of walking - took 2 hours, altho we left after 1.5 hours because our host was waiting for us.

Tours are at 3 pm, 6 pm and 8 pm - we took the 8 pm on a Friday night.  The days and months you visit NOLA will affect the amount of people who will be on the streets in the French Quarter.  Beginning of April is prior to French Quarter Fest and Jazz Fest and the crowds were just right.  Lots of action, but not painfully crowded.

In my opinion, it's Las Vegas, San Diego, & DTLA all in one area. Party Central bar-hopping with a mix genre of music, both DJ's spinning and live bands performing. There were several strip clubs and a good number of fancy restaurant choices in the mix.

We had enough time to check out both areas during our first visit (we definitely plan on making another trip back). Bourbon Street was fun but Frenchmen Street was a BLAST!!

Chili mac - 
You get a giant bowl and it looks incredible. The mac and cheese part is good but the chili was too spicy for us and so we had to leave it behind.

TtuLyYy4Gf41XA2JUQgY8A,1,"I am appalled by the lack of professionalism at this place. Spend your 10k for a wedding elsewhere where people will actually value your money and will be nice to you. In the middle of planning our wedding, we got switched to a different coordinator who made it clear through email and in person that she did not want to deal with us. She treated us as if she did not want to deal with us because she did not make commission from our wedding. And let me say this, I am by no means a bridezilla. We're all human, all I ask is that if you mess up, you apologize for it and be nice to me if I am spending money at your establishment. 

  Planning my ""destination"" wedding started off great at the Grand Plaza. I was working with Kate and visited the property. She was warm, friendly and helpful. We even met with another coordinator who was friendly as well. 9 months before my wedding I got an email saying that Kate is no longer with the company and that Kristin would be taking care of us. I emailed Kristin early September to say that we would be in the area on the 13th to the 16th of this month and could we do our tasting. Due to our flights and the timing that they offer tastings, we could only squeeze in a 30 minute tasting. We had been emailing back and forth confirming the 16th. Kristin emailed me the menu selections on the 20th. Not once did she mention that she needed the tasting menu selections back within a certain time frame. I emailed her on the 12th with our menu selections to which she responded ""Unfortunately, we need a two week notice for a tasting. Is there any other time you can come in?""  I emailed her back reminding her that this was a destination wedding so there is no other time and that we had been discussing coming in on the 16th since the beginning of September and not once did she mention a deadline or follow up if she needed them back in a certain time. On the 13th I spoke with her and her response was very dry ""yeah I see what you mean."" Never apologized but said they were able to do the tasting. 
 That Saturday, October 14th when we had an actual meeting with Kristin and a tour of the property. Throughout the tour, Kristin was very condescending, unhelpful and unfriendly. When we asked questions, she responded as if our questions were stupid. She talked to us like we were children. She even rolled her eyes when I asked to see guest rooms. This was after I mentioned on the phone and when we first arrived that it was my fiancé's first time at the property so he wanted to see guest rooms. During the meeting, I brought up the fact that she spelled our names wrong in the email. She looked at the screen, looked at the file and then said ""yeah it's in here right,"" again looking at us like we were stupid. Again, never apologizing!  Today, I spoke with Gloria, the assistant manager, who offered to switch me to a different coordinator. She apologized and said they would handle it on their end but kept bringing up ""personalities not meshing."" Personalities have nothing to do with professionalism. After a lot of haggling, Gloria offered the additional $150 I left for the glamour room but refused to give me back the $500 deposit as if I want to plan an entire wedding again six months before my date!",10/20/2017 21:06

The tour guide/bartender gave us a view of the distillery and all the equipment that creates these liquors. Most of the canisters were made from copper. 

After that, we went to taste more drinks. We had probably about 10 mini shots of all the liquors they made. From whiskey, vodka, bourbon, gin, to sweet dessert drinks. Then we went to the gift store after the tour concluded.

I just couldn't imagine what the hype was about, but it became a personal quest to get reservations one day while visiting Philly. 

Then came COVID... I was with my Uber-picky, seven-year-old god-daughter and her vegetarian father and they had outdoor seating available for four. So we were finally gonna check out Vedge!

Y'all I am reformed!!! This was the most amazing meal I've had in a LONG time and that's saying a LOT!! They have an abbreviated menu with only 4 appetizers and 4 entrees available, so we ordered one of everything to share amongst the table. My God-daughter tried and loved almost everything!!

If I had to rank the courses it would go something like this:
#1. Rutabaga Fondue - I am a cheese lover and I didn't even miss the cheese! And that pretzel roll.... Good lawdy!!! 

#2 Chocolate cookie and key lime ice cream. Both were to die for!!! Still with no dairy!!!

#3 Dirt List Salad

#4 Avocado stuffed with deviled hearts of palm, heirloom tomatoes, green gazpacho vinaigrette and black salt - the stuffing was very dill forward but still yummy

#5 Smoked Portobello Carpaccio with caper vinaigrette and  nicoise potato salad -this was delish!!

#6 Charred Broccoli with spicy sesame noodles, smoky trumpet mushrooms and shaved cucumber salad. *contains gluten and sesame - loved this one too!! Perfect 

#7 Gochujang Glazed Tofu with edamame cream, nori and charred corn salad - tofu wasn't very firm but had a great char

#8 Bourbon Poached Peaches over decadent chocolate  was very rich and delicious!!

#9 Gold Bar Squash with chermoula, warm red lentils and a tomato olive salad - very Mediterranean

#10 Maitake Mushroom with smoked Chile glaze, black bean corn masa, whipped avocado and vegetable escabeche - my least favorite of the night

I purchased a very expensive dining room table, I was totally in love with it. I got home, everything was set up and looked beautiful, however the glass insert was chipped, they replaced that with a new one. Okay, moving forward, a month later the table's finish started to peel. A peeling finish was upsetting for sure, however I reached out to Bliss Home's customer service and was in contact with Nina.
Well, she promised me that the table would be repaired by their repairperson, we have been having problems with this table since June 2021, and I have only had it 3 weeks.
What they don't understand is when you pay for something NEW, you don't expect to get a REPAIRED item!!!!!!
I asked for them to please just replace my table with the table that they took the broken glass insert from, but that idea was ignored.
They would rather repair first, it should be that they make the customers' desire more important than theirs.

The pizza is good.  The crust is crunchy and doughy at the same time.   My pizza was wet -- perhaps I needed to let it set but I was starving.  The topping were fresh mushrooms (I kinda miss the canned 'shrooms) and red onions.  I can't complain too much as I ate 3 slices - it was breakfast/lunch.  

I had time to kill so I ordered 3 shots of espresso over ice.  They gave me 4 shots -- BONUS right?!?!  But they gave me two coffee cups each with two shots.

Made reservations and were seated pretty quickly. Waitress seemed a little distracted a few times which lead to a wrong dinner being ordered which was an ok substitution, but ended up costing about $7 more AND didn't get end of dinner tea! But she somewhat made it ok by getting us all (even though it came with some meals) complimentary ice cream. 

Each of our dinners were pretty good. Tuna special was REally good and cooked just right. The Ocean Treasure was great due to I was craving it... but other than that, it was just lobster, shrimp, and scallops... not all that special. A taste of the Teriyaki steak was good but glad it wasn't my meal because that flavor could become too much too quick! Taste of the Hibachi steak = New York strip AND the 'other' dinner which had filet mignon with shrimp was good, just nothing extraordinary.

The soup was good, the salad was good though it could have used a little less of the ginger dressing. Like the fried rice a lot! Very tasty! And the sides/appetizers of shrimp, zucchini, and onions was also pretty good! Also had the spider roll (sushi) which was really tasty, but should have been a little longer - couple more pieces.

But above all, what you are going for is the show! And as always, it is always fun!! Our chef had only been there a couple weeks, so his talent may not have been as refined as others... but is also wasn't as rehearsed as others! Had fun with him and enjoyed the show!

BJNxQGG3dx5uLxINGA5kDg,4,"I haven't had steak in a long time and I had some business in South Tampa so I   was pondering Terra Gaucha. I have pretty much stopped going to buffets since I have lost a lot of weight in the last few years, but I 
haven't been to a South American steakhouse in 7-8 yrs (Texas De Brazil)

Note: If you've not done so join their email club, they will email you a $15 dollar coupon. I did this and was able to use it today.

Let the tempting of the Uric Acid Gods begin!

TGBS is in a plaza which is attached to Salon Loft and a Credit Union. It is adjacent to Wright's Gourmet House. Thankfully, there is adequate parking in a lot.

The interior is very classy with mostly a light gray motif. The salad bar is in the center  of the dining area. Many waiters are scurrying about attending to guests with gray outfits and the gauchos are clad in red shirts and are brandishing skewers. Depending on the time of day, you can just get the salad bar or just the meats I went with the full dining experience at $45.

I ordered a Caiprinha. It is a Brazilian staple alcoholic drink with lime,sugar ,and cachaca (spirit from fermented sugarcane IIRC) In a superficial sense, it taste similar to mojito, but more robust. It was very strong ($10).  4.5/5

The Salad Bar was very elaborate and had more non veg items than veg from hat I could see. It included cheese, prosciutto, salami, french bread, salad, bacon, roasted peppers, a mushroom dish I can't spell. While it was the most varied salad bars I've seen, I didn't sample everything to due to being more excited for the meats. I didn't see Lobster Bisque there like Annah P said Darn.

Many South American Steakhouses use a system where you place a disk with green side up to indicate to the gauchos that you want meat. Red side up means you don't want meat served. They have many cuts of different meat including steak, chicken, pork , salmon.  

What I prefer about the SAS is that imo they season the meat better than American ones. Some people have mentioned that  meat is too salty at these types of restaurants, but I did not feel that here at TGBS.  I tried picanha, sirloin, rib, chicken , and sausages. They even have proteins you can request. A couple ahead of me got a grilled shrimp skewer. Neat.

In addition to the meat, other servers bring mashed potatoes, sweet plaintains, grilled pineapple slices, and cassava cheese bread. 

 Picanha and sirloin were soft , juicy, and packed with flavor.  5/5
Everything  else was generally  4/5.
The Cassava Cheese bread was serviceable. It's a nice idea and its different but the taste was just ok. To be honest, filling up with side dishes especially starch wasn't part of my game plan.  3/5

The service was magnificent. The gauchos were on point and polite. The other servers were generous with the other non meat side dishes. Water was refilled with the efficiency of a military unit under General Patton.   It is truly commensurate with the price of the meal.  Indian restaurants should send their servers here for boot camp.  5/5

From all this gushing , you would expect a 5/5 mark, but the one main negative is price. While the product is good, the price is prohibitive. This is mostly a place for special occasions like birthdays,anniversaries, etc. 
The lunch service is around $30, but Im sure the variety is less compared to the dinner service. Plus, eating this much red meat frequently would make all the gastroenterologists of the world turn into the Hulk.  I cannot say if TGBS is better than Texas De Brazil, Fogo De Chau, and all the other similar , but it is indeed a great special meal in a nice venue with exemplary service.",2/18/2019 3:42

JLmpKM9AsEATkkBgLCgQKg,1,"Not good. It was a struggle to order a family meal to go. Hostess was clueless, i was put on hold for about 15 min and next person was as equally clueless. Finally told me to call back in morning. 
Decided to go and order in person the next day. Hostess send us to bartender. He was busy but took our order for pick up the next afternoon. 
Went to pick up and clueless hostess sent me to bartender again, fiod not ready and told to wait.No offer of beverage or water while waiting, and she was also too busy to be bothered with takeout order. 

The food: lasagne was heated according to directions, but was lacking in flavor and kind of chewy. Salad was fresh romaine with cheese and crutons, but no salad dressing in bag or on salad. Bread was too dense for my diners. They also said it didn't have and garlic flavor. It was like garlic butter poured on top, but nothing on the actual slices.
Lastly and the worst was the tiramisu. Looked ok in container, but was a soupy mess. If there were lady fingers they disolved into the coffee flavored goo in the container.  Was there alcohol in it? Opinions were mixed, we did not want alcohol in it. 
We served this meal about 2 hours after pick up, so no excuse for awful dessert unless it was made long before and thawed out.
Nope. Won't  revisit. Typical bland american style chain restaurant. Half of the menu is bar drinks, so maybe that explains all the rave reviews. Side note, there was extra sauce included with no idea what we were to do with it. One was an awful, a garlic parmesan sauce that tasted like it was starting to go sour. 

There was just nothing good about anything.",7/9/2021 23:39

The layout of the Alamo reminded me of my childhood road trips with my family, except  this place had the fancy showers and laundromat.

Iron skillet itself had such a cozy feel to it and our waitress was super nice, she had such a homey feeling to her. I ordered the country fried steak with a side of pancakes, the BF ordered a hamburger. The food came out on a pretty cool looking skillet and the food was hot. Everything we ordered was good, no complaints. The country fried steak was crispy, well seasoned, and the gravy was not at all plain. The hamburger was cooked as we requested (medium) and it was well put together.

vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ,5,"While eating my dinner last week from Bangkok, I couldn't help but feel like I was taking time to reacquaint myself with an old friend. Bangkok was one of the first restaurants I loved in Reno. We'd drive from the NW regularly to enjoy the food, and always loved the lively atmosphere of everyone gathered on a Friday or Saturday night. 

I can still remember the first time I had the Bangkok Sizzling Platter. The fresh spinach was bright green on arrival, but after pouring the peanut sauce over the top you could watch and smell as it sauteed together with the protein all on a sizzling platter. Intoxicating aromas filled the air and the people you were dining with were always jealous they didn't get the same thing. 

As I moved south, I sadly lost touch with Bangkok, as I began to favor the convenience of restaurants closer to me. During API Heritage Month 2021 though, I've been getting out and exploring these spots again, and I'm so glad I made this a priority.

Bangkok has some serious history in the community (25 years to be exact). You can see it in the smiles that fill the room and feel it in the air too. Everyone is a friend from the minute you walk in the door, and after tasting the food, you'll know exactly why so many have been coming for all these years.

On my recent visit I tried the Thai Dumplings, duck larb, black pepper beef, and the fried calamari, all of which were phenomenal. I'm coming back for the crispy duck and the stuffed wings, along with several other dishes that were calling to me but I couldn't have in one visit! 

Bangkok Cuisine was one of the bright spots for me in 2020. While the restaurant industry was facing some of the most difficult circumstances ever, Kris L kept his team focused and motivated through it all, and even found ways to give back to others who needed it more than they did. 

I hope you'll give it a try too!",5/18/2021 0:59

The staff here are very friendly, the food is awesome, and the ambience is great!  We ordered hamburgers and fries there and it did not disappoint.  They have outdoor seating or indoor seating on picnic benches, and at night, you might even be able to catch some fireflies!

In any case, we did have to wait about 45 minutes to be seated, but I chalk that up to good business.  We'll plan to come earlier next time.

_9TJr3HMlhRJBwtASgaCdQ,5,"I grew up in the asian community with a cluster of ethnic restaurants. Later in life, I moved away from this community to pursue a career and to travel the world. That same community was the San Gabriel Valley, an area in Los Angeles that is famously known for Asian food. I found myself in Saint Louis and came across this top notch Taiwanese food. Since then, I've been coming here for about a year, and it is actually one of the best places in Saint Louis. This level of quality, service, and speed is on par as most restaurants in my hometown in the San Gabriel Valley. This place is deserving of all recognitions, being true to its distinct flavor.

Here are some points:

1. The food is quick.  They have a productive army of cooks in the kitchen that does an amazing job.

2. The rice is well-cooked, and it is an important litmus test. Just imagine what could go wrong if an establishment cannot make their rice correctly.

3. The staff are amazing, attentive, and direct. 

4. They give you your bill before you finish your meal, so you can pay them while you are still eating. By the time you're done eating, you can just leave because you already paid by then. This is very efficient!

5. Their dishes are otherworldly --- fried chicken, ground beef with black beans, bok choy, cabbage, and etc. The staff has greatly help me with picking these dishes. 

6. This place is located in the back of the strip mall. It feels a little sketchy, but that's where the best resturant is located at.

Without even being able to have a normal discussion or allow for any possibility that a mistake was made, he basically lost his mind and accused the contractors people of using tape and not painters tape to mask it off (although he doesn't actually know if that happened) and saying that it's in his contract not to use any adhesive and that he didn't do anything wrong.  I mean literally within seconds of just trying to ascertain an issue he lost control of his emotions and it was impossible to even talk about it. It was obvious he would never remotely consider he could make a mistake. Really odd to fly off the handle as a business person.

I bought a cute little Honda Fit here once when I was going through the worst spiral downfall of my life. I needed lower payments, something that would fit all 4 of my big dogs, and something reliable. 

First of all don't go with their loan options, the interest percentages are atrocious. I would recommend going with a credit union and finding the loan yourself. BUT if the car starts having issues immediately and you want to return it there is something you should know. 

My Fit suddenly started having problems that arose just about 48 hours after purchase. Also I can't stress enough CHECK THE CAR FROM TOP TO BOTTOM FRONT TO BACK INSIDE AND OUT. The side of the bumper was coming apart, the trunk would get jammed etc. Things you really wouldn't think about whole test driving.

I returned the car about 2 weeks later as they have a 30 day return policy. They weren't happy and were super rude. They were supposed to send the check that I brought in back to the credit union where I got the loan.
Fast forward one month I get a notification saying I'm past due for a payment on this car that is no longer mine. They never sent the check and they wouldn't tell me what was happening. They even hung up on me when I called in. They would no longer communicate with me.

I ended up calling corporate and complaining. They had it handled in 3 days.

Employees are rude can't be bothered types. Place is filthy because the rude can't be bothered types can't be bothered to do anything but have an attitude and mess up your order. The drive thru is a joke. And when you get stuck waiting in it forever you can't leave cuz there's no way to go around, so you're trapped. They've never once gotten my order right. Never. I'll  ask for BBQ sauce and they'll hand me the bag literally two seconds later without it. And then have an attitude when you ask for it again. Last time, I opened my bag while still sitting there because I was positive it wouldn't be right. I was literally missing 4 things. And I had to ask four separate times for the stuff because I'd tell her about 1 thing missing and she'd slam the door shut go get it and come back so I'd have to keep saying what's missing one by one. Just so needlessly rude. And I have terrible anxiety so I HATE having to ask for the missing things and all that. But what can you do when they don't give you half your stuff! It's honestly the most poorly run fast food establishment I've ever been to in my life. And it's such a shame, because the chicken sandwich is pretty good. The last 2 times I tried to go- I didn't even get served. One time they said they were closed when it was more then an hour before closing time, and the second time they literally just came over the intercom and said they were ""out of product."" It's a Taco Bell/KFC combo, so you're telling me you were out of absolutely everything from both places?! Yeah, sure. The cars in front of us were served, so I'm assuming they just decided they were done early. They seem to do that often. Oh and like I said before, you're trapped in the drive thru, so I had to sit there and wait for the people in front of us who actually did get served to get thru. So I sat in a drive thru for 15 minutes to not get any food. That was the final straw. I'll never go back there. Really wish they would overhaul that place cuz like I said, I really like the food.

u1coHew6_4Asf_5rY7zm4A,5,"Never had mullet before, had no idea what it looked or tasted like other than photos on Yelp. I am a sucker for grilled seafood so I headed out to Seffner to find this place with the great reviews. Sims food truck is easy to spot, sitting on a corner lot next to a Subway sandwich shop and a motel. I was already impressed just seeing the super large smoker sitting next to it in full swing of preparing what I hoped was a fresh hot meal for me. Just my luck, I was right. I asked for the mullet which was quoted at having a wait of 30 mins, but eventually ended up taking an hour. I wasn't in a rush so I didn't mind. I took the time to find a local store to shop and got back in time to be handled this massive bag with the mullet wrapped in foil. Dang! I didn't know these were so huge! I'm glad that I didn't order any sides, mynbelly would bust. Got my food back home and dug in. Tasted like tuna to me, thick consistency compared to my usual catfish. I got some smoky barbeque sauce for dipping and the meal was perfect! Of course I didn't finish this fillet in one sitting so this covered lunch and dinner for me. Warning for newbies: there are a lot of bones in this so be careful when eating.

Props to the staff, they were super friendly and helpful. I was actually surprised considering it was two young men doing all the work. They nicely advised me to either call in or place my order online to avoid wait times. Good tip for future visits. I just wanted to see what everything looked like up close and personal.",9/30/2020 1:04

On my last massage, Cindy remembered my trouble area of my lower back and went to work giving me one of the best massages I have ever had.

Waiting a hour to get a table at 6pm on a friday very understandable not mad at that at all , but just mad at waited a hour to sit down and my table has clean plates and utensils but the table was never cleaned off , it was pretty damn nasty . 

If the prices are that high i want better dinning experience or better quality in the food.  My mac and cheese burger was avg . It was a good sizer tho i guess i give the koodos on that with the portions .

The fried cheese was really good too ,

I could've easily driven past this place... it's so unassuming from the outside but the interior is absolutely stunning. I could see myself sitting there for hours with my laptop as if it were a coffee shop. The interior itself was welcoming, as was the staff. The young woman that helped me was so kind and helpful. I was obviously overwhelmed by their options, but she was great! I got two donuts (Cookies & Cream and Sandy Beach) and an iced latte.  The latte was delicious, which was nice considering some donut spots rely on just the donuts. Of course the donuts were incredible. Nashville is home to quite a few donut spots by now, but these stand out to me. The dough itself isn't super sweet, and the texture is just perfect. Because of those factors, the toppings are able to shine more without it feeling like I was eating straight sugar. Perfect donut in my eyes!",8/11/2021 16:07

Rufino at JR had his crew, Nick and Joe, come and take a look to see what was wrong. Great guys - very efficient and friendly. They checked voltages etc., and ascertained that it was the LED's that had burnt out. It turns out that whoever installed them used strips that were not suitable for outdoor use. They worked out what would be needed to replace the arrays with units suitable for outdoor/wet conditions. In addition I had them take a look at installing a 220V outlet under our gas cook top as we are planning to go electric, plus installing an outside 120V outlet.
It took a while to get the necessary arrays (Covid is slowing everything down) but once they had them they came immediately and installed them. These were long arrays and installed under concrete coping stones around the curved patio walls. Not a simple task but done beautifully and efficiently. The 220V outlet was done just a efficiently, involving crawl space work, etc. Everything cleaned up perfectly and the outside 120V outlet installed. These guys are consummate pros.

Mi Amor had a bourbon based drink which had some hints if vanilla and cherry in it!!! It was AMAZING!!!! He also tried a coffee bourbon drink which he says was ok, but not as good as the first drink. 

My first drink was a vodka based drink and it was super refreshing! By far one of the best vodka based drinks I've had in a long time! I also tried a tequila drink which was more on the Smokey side. It was ok, not as good as the vodka drink. The tequila started off sweet but then had a Smokey hard after taste which I did not care for.

We also tried the devil eggs of the day which were truffle. They tasted the way they were described, like truffle eggs. They were ok, I wouldn't order them again but I will always ask about the devil egg flavor of the day!

There's also a dip of the day too! They don't have an extensive food menu as they are more of a drink bar, but the little bit of food options they have are the perfect pairing for this spot.

The third course was a literal taste of heaven, and im telling you, if you're having a bad day, TRY THIS and you will forget the whole day even happened. I cant even.

The sauce is robust and there's a good amount on the pies. I can't speak to the many different pizzas they offer because I'm a Hawaiian pizza girl but it is top notch!!!! For pineapple lovers, this pie is for you! For some, the pineapple to ham ratio might be too much for you. There is a lot of pineapples on it. For me, I consider that a perk. Prices are decent! This location is located on streets of St. Charles which is a very crowded area. 

One of the biggest downfalls is the lack of apps offered on the menu. I really enjoy some T-Ravs or garlic knots with my pizza but they don't offer anything of that sort. That's a bummer!!! 

Still my favorite pizza place and I look forward to eating it each time!

For starters, the drinks can be crazy overpriced. And all the hard alcohol is warm. The security is a total joke, there was a night when capacity was hit and they put a biker gang in charge of security. They were only letting in their biker friends, just ignoring most of the people in line. 

And worst of all, the DJ. Where do I begin. She is usually on something. Hammered out of her mind, or completely drugged up. She only plays what she wants to hear, and totally ignores any and all requests that are made (even when people tip her to play something). And she will very often go on these huge ""fuck sisolak"" rants or yell at people dancing if they don't do a dance the way she wants.

MDDdx6uia7LXNDqkUO9w4Q,2,"We tried Paloma's for the first time yesterday getting the crab cake entree for take out.  When we got home, we were surprised that the ""main course"" portion included a single crab cake, a tablespoon or two of wild rice, and a bit of wilted spinach.  The portion filled only about a third of the take-out container.  We are not typically focused on portion size, but this was a little ridiculous for a $24 main course.  We called the restaurant to confirm they did not mistakenly give us an appetizer portion and were told that what we received was the main course.  The entree tasted fine (despite the crab cake being overworked to the point where you could not find any evidence of lump crab meat) but we would have been much happier to have paid more for a proper entree size portion than having to make  a sandwich after eating our dinner!  I think any reasonable diner would assume that a main course would have more than a single crab cake!  Anyone else have a problem with portion sizes of other main courses???",3/20/2021 13:11

That was over a YEAR ago.  I made many follow up calls AND VISITS to try to get my refund. I kept ALL paperwork.

She took us over to the buffet and pointed out all the dishes that were vegetarian and did not include dairy. She even made roti specially for me.

My first time was elsewhere and I had a horrible experience but decided to try again and I'm very glad I went to infinity float. I had a ton of questions which were all answered by the orientation video but Paige (I think that was her name!) made sure I was set after learning about my less-than-ideal first float. She was really committed to making sure I had an amazing float, which helped me relax. 

As for the float itself, I enjoyed being in the pod. My first float was in a more open pool which wasn't for me. The pods have buttons to control the light, music, and lid. Being able to control all aspects of the experience mitigated any anxiety I felt.

vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ,3,"This one is tough. Asian Paradise was my go to neighborhood Chinese restaurant for quite some time. I can recall sending a lot of great folks there over the years as well. I loved the fact they offered a very diverse menu that represented several Asian cuisines, and that they offered some pretty authentic dishes and versions of popular dishes as well.

I'm reducing my previous 5 star review as a result of two recent experiences here. Truthfully the food served last night was closer to a two, but I know this restaurant does better so I'm giving the benefit of the doubt.

The first was about a mont and a half ago. It was a Sunday evening and we wanted Chinese takeout, but knowing the current status of the restaurant industry, I called to be sure they were open before we ordered. A gentleman answered and affirmed they were open, but politely let me know it was takeout only until about 6/7 due to a large private party that was in the dining room. I let him know I wanted takeout and that id call back in 5 minutes with an order. 

Literally 5 minutes later I started calling. I rang both phone numbers listed for Asian Paradise no less than a combined 50 times (no exaggeration), both simply landing me in a voicemail confirming I was in the right place. I eventually left a voicemail just to see if I'd get a call back, but 6 weeks later and still nothing.

Last night we got to order! Three dishes: Kung Pao Triple Delight dry style, House Pan Fried Noodle and Salt & Pepper Calamari.

The calamari was tough. My son chewed his way through it and I didn't get more than a bite. After that bite I thought about calling the restaurant but decided this must be what they serve and assumed I'd ordered poorly.

The Kung Pao was generally tasty, but several pieces of the beef were extremely tough and inedible. I also couldn't tell if what we got was the dry style. Perhaps it was, just a little more saucy than I'm used to seeing. Aside from the saucy look that I wasn't expecting, it was also hiding a helluva Ma La punch from Sichuan peppercorns. I believe Kung Pao has origins in Sichuan, but if that's the standard here, the Americanized palate needs a little heads up that's coming. I've not experienced that Sichuan flavor profile in this dish at any restaurant that didn't specifically call it out. I enjoy that type of numbing spice, so this was kinda fun for me, but I'd imagine it would be pretty painful for those that didn't know.

The pan fried noodles were the biggest disappointment. I appreciated that they packed the crispy noodles separately from the gravy so we didn't end up with soggy noodles by the time we got home, but the gravy itself was more cornstarch than anything else. This dish is supposed to have a delicate brown gravy that gently coats the protein and vegetables and crispy noodles, but this had way too much thickener and was best described as gloppy and gelatinous. This was not a good version of this dish and was borderline inedible.

So two dishes I didn't want to or couldn't eat and a third my spice loving soul struggled to complete add up to a n  experience that was really not that great. I'm not sure if something changed here during the last few years, but this isn't the Asian Paradise I used to love.",8/3/2021 4:45

ZamM2xHZtUJrXWJm9Rvsmg,3,"The atmosphere and decor are pretty cool, the wait staff and employees were super nice. We heard it was a family dining restaurant, so we brought our children with us. (ages 10 and 2) Our 10 year old ordered a bacon cheeseburger off the kids menu. It was GIANT, it was the same size as ours! Our 2 year old also had a burger. (We should have known better and ordered one that they could have split it.) There were no fruit side options for the kids to choose from. 
Due to them running out of highchairs, we were seated in a hightop booth with a booster seat for our toddler. The booster normally wouldn't have been a problem, but it was pretty sketchy having him sit in a booster in such a high booth. We had to scoot the table closer to him so he could reach the table, thus leaving the table short on the other side for the rest of the family. We were told that they were out of high chairs. We finally requested a move to another table after a family with a toddler using a regular high chair left. That made our seating arrangement 100% better. 
The menu is pretty cut and dry...and easy to order from. I got the 317 Burger, as suggested by our waiter. (beef patty, garlic aioli, pepper bacon and cheese) I also ordered the poutine fries. 
The burger looked great on the plate, it was adorned with a bamboo skewer with a pickle on top....
The flavor was not very good at all, the bun was GIANT and dry and the bacon wasn't crispy at all.  The garlic aioli was hard to find, and hard to taste. I ended up taking the top portion of the bun off and cutting the burger with a fork and knife and dipping into ketchup and the gravy from the poutine. 
The poutine was pretty good. The fries were delicious and freshly cut. The cheese curds weren't very melty, but the gravy was great! Overall, that part was what I ate the most of!

I am super excited for this business....but it will be a while before we return so they will be able to work out the kinks.",12/15/2013 15:48

The seamstress did not do a great job and charged an exorbitant amount of money. And when wearing the gown for the big day, I kept having to adjust it because it was still too loose in some areas. The store staff is rude and unaccommodating.

Eventually we left town on vacation and really, I'm sure after a couple days there was no more availability. The e-mail mentioned a written notice would be sent through mail, but that didn't happen.

RjdZ2sSWY4GREWDp_ms5Vw,2,"What a shame!  This movie house has been renovated and unfortunately, they missed doing it for the customers satisfaction!  

First - what's good:  The heating and air conditioning are great.  In fact, they tend to set the air on super chill, so take boots and socks to keep warm.  The projection and sound systems are state of the art and wonderful.

And then the good news stops.

The seats, while bigger than the previous ones, are still aligned, so you can't see over the head of the person in front of you!  Why, oh why, couldn't they offset the seats so everyone could see?  Then there is the problem of the first seven rows... for some curious reason, these rows are more elevated than those behind them.  Which means that anyone sitting in rows 8-12 cannot see at all!!!!!   My question is this... why didn't they just increase the slope and make it so everyone could see the screen?

The screen has been raised quite a lot, so you would think everyone could see, but it's still a problem.  And, since this theater is all about the interviews with celebrities, why, oh why, didn't they put in a platform so we could see them during the Q&A's?  No one but the first couple of rows can see the interview because the celebrities are seated so low...

And, the promised improvements to the snack bar area are nowhere to be seen.  It's still too small; in the way of entry to the cinema and sells crap snack foods.  Gosh - they moved the popcorn to the opposite side... is this supposed to be an improvement?!  I think not.  And the air-popped popcorn is just as awful as the previous stuff.

Grg4KcIRq7OVt_hBi5KPTA,1,"We've been going to McCordsville Veterinary Hospital for about 5 years, and spending $3,000 for its care in that time.  The Doctors are professional, thorough and attentive.  However, the issue we have is with the front-office staff, the face of the practice.  I've had more than one negative encounter with the check-in staff, but this encounter was inexcusable.  

Our dog injured herself and I wanted to just get an initial assessment on the severity of the wound. My thought was could it wait until I scheduled an appointment for the next day, or should something be done immediately?  

I asked the check-in staff at McCordsville Veterinary Hospital if someone could just take 5 minutes and look at the wound.  I admit, the time was later in the afternoon, but I was told there was no way anyone could see my pet.  I could take her to the Animal Emergency Hospital in Carmel, followed with that ""is all we can offer"". I was also offered an appointment the next day, which I took.

Intuitively I thought the injury wasn't life-threatening, but I wanted peace of mind and the animal's health ensured. I drove to McCordsville Veterinary Hospital and called from the lot, to ask again if someone would just come out and assess our dog's wound.  As I waited with the other two cars in the lot, I was again told it was not possible for anyone to come out. 

I took her to a nearby groomer, thinking she could be helpful.  The groomer gave me her opinion, and a referral to a nearby Vet, Oaklandon Family Vet.  I called that Vet on my way there to explain the situation.  Without any established relationship, or hesitation the Vet said to bring my dog in, but that I may have to wait until they could get my pet in between appointments.  

As I waited with the 4 other cars at the curbside, the Oaklandon Family Vet examined the dog, described what she found and prescribed treatment.  It was all over within 45 minutes after leaving the McCordsville Vet.  

There is this overriding schedule rigidness in the McCordsville Veterinary Hospital's practice that I have experienced more than once.   Even more maddening was when the practice called our home to confirm the next day's appointment.  A Vet from the practice got on the phone with my wife, while I was en-route with our dog to the new Vet, again explaining why McCordsville Veterinary Hospital couldn't see the animal.  I believe altogether my wife and I spent 15 minutes on the phone being told how there was no time to see our dog.  

The Oaklandon Vet has since called us to see how our dog is doing.  That's remarkable service.  They're our veterinarian now.",7/18/2020 16:09

j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,4,"Masala Kitchen Kati Rolls and Platters really hit the spot after a long day of traveling. The rolls here were cooked to order and delicious. They were also affordable and served up fast. What more can you ask for?

We had a late check-in at our hotel and were hungry. We ended up leaving our hotel for dinner around 11:15pm. I looked on Yelp for a good, quick, casual place to eat that was also open late. We were tired and I didn't feel like eating at a sit-down restaurant. Masala Kitchen popped up and checked all the boxes. They're open until 3:30am on Friday and Saturday nights. A friend also recommended this place to us.

This is a small fast-casual restaurant located in Center City, just four blocks from Philadelphia City Hall. It's right next to the entrance of a public parking garage. Seating inside is limited to about 24 seats. They have standard two-tops with Tolix chairs and a couple long high-tops with Tolix stools.

During our visit late on a Friday night between 11pm-12am, there was a small, but steady stream of customers. Most of the orders were takeout and delivery. We were the only dine-in customers at the time. The restaurant had plenty of staff on-hand. The kitchen is open. Bottled and canned drinks (from a fridge), sauces, eating utensils, and napkins are self-serve. The space itself is simple and looked relatively new and clean. The ambiance is that of a takeout joint. Since this restaurant is close to a lot of bars, it's perfect for those wanting a late-night snack or meal after a night on the town.

The menu is in the business name: kati rolls and platters. Kati rolls are an Indian street food from Kolkata (Calcutta), West Bengal. Masala Kitchen offers 14 varieties of kati rolls, ranging in price from $4.50 to $5.75 a roll. Buy two kati rolls, get $1 off. One or two rolls is good enough for a meal for most people. Ingredient options include chicken, beef, lamb, paneer (cheese), egg, vegetables, potatoes, Indian spices, and more.

The platters remind me of the platters you can get from The Halal Guys. For example, they have a Chicken-N-Rice platter ($8.75) and the self-serve sauces are similar too -- creamy white and spicy red. In addition, you can get biryani ($9.25-$10.00 each) and a paneer platter ($10). Drinks include mango and rose lassi ($3.70 each), chaas (an Indian yogurt drink, $3.70), masala chai ($3), and more.

The two of us ordered and split the following three rolls:

* Chicken Masala ($5.75) - marinated grilled chicken with Indian creamy tomato sauce ""Makhani"" and crispy onions
* Achari Paneer ($5.50) - marinated paneer with hint of mango pickle sauce, fresh mint-coriander chutney, and crispy onions
* Mix Veggie ($5.50) - fresh pea, carrot, and green bean mixture cooked in Indian spices with fresh mint-coriander chutney and crispy onions plus egg (+$0.50)

These rolls were great. My favorite was the achari paneer, but I'm fan of paneer. Everything was made fresh to order and came out piping hot. Each roll was wrapped in brown paper and Sharpied to identify the rolls.

The kati rolls are wrapped in what the restaurant calls a ""tawa roti."" Traditionally, tawa refers to the round, flat metal griddle used in Indian cooking. The roti here had a nice thickness to it, soft, and kind of fluffy with a sort of pillowy texture, lightly charred and appetizing. I like to describe Masala Kitchen's kati rolls as the Indian equivalent of the Taco Bell Chalupa or Gordita. In terms of the shell/wrap, they are more similar to the Gordita (softer, less crispy, not deep fried).

Each of the rolls was packed with flavor. If you like Indian food, I don't think the kati rolls here will disappoint you. The authentic, aromatic, and mouthwatering flavors were all there. The Mixed Veggie roll had a mushier consistency than the other rolls, but that wasn't surprising given the ingredients. I think adding egg to that roll really enhanced it. On the menu and item descriptions above, ""crispy onions"" refer to fresh, raw slices of red onion.

For sauces, I recommend getting a cup of the white sauce, adding a little bit of red to it, and mixing them together. The red sauce is quite spicy so a little goes a long way. The sauces by themselves are tasty too, so really it's a matter of personal preference. I dipped the rolls into the sauce mixture each time I took a bite. Yum.

JewsUq_3GaFEtVaoFwiigg,4,I had not returned to this location in years due to a bad experience. My friend said he liked the place so we went. The place had changed but had the food? They had a Mongolian grill which was well stocked and excellent. The regular food was a notch above most Chinese buffets and they kept it well stocked. Lots of variety and choices to keep you coming back for more. The deserts were pretty much the same as all the rest of the Chinese buffets in the United States. Luckily watermelon was in season so that was a tasty end to my meal. My buddy and I walked out of there stuffed for less than $25 bucks. I will return.,8/1/2021 20:36

Snibkmu9icOiNSKvnQEFNA,4,"I visited El Jefe's on a Sunday evening. I sat at a video poker free seat at the front bar alone. 

I sat there for over five minutes while three staff members, including a manager, buzzed around the bar helping customers and counting inventory. I got up, went to the back bar where the staff were gathered, and told them I was sitting there. 

The manager brought me water and a few minutes later one of the bartenders came over to take my order. He was very friendly! 

I asked for a mezcal margarita. Instead, he made me the signature Cadillac Margarita with a mezcal floater. I'm not a Cadillac fan, but, the acid and savory nature of the mezcal cut through the sweetness of the OJ. It was so good - I ordered a second! 

I ordered the quesabirria (the bartender said it was great and I love it!), however, the kitchen was out (it's a rather special dish, so I wasn't surprised). I asked his other favorite dish and he recommended the Shrimp Diablo Tacos. And yes - he was very genuine in his suggestion. 

It was a hearty portion with refried beans, fresh salsa, rice, and two tacos. 

I requested chips and salsa twice from the bartender but did not receive them. I love crunch with my Mexican food, and I'm happy to pay extra for chips and salsa. I noticed that folks in the dining room around me were getting complimentary chips. However, I noticed people by themselves weren't. Since I did not receive them from the bartender, I asked the runner who brought my food. He had to go out of his way to ask the manager if he could give me chips and salsa. She said yes.

As a woman who travels around the world alone, nothing annoys me more than being ignored, ""missed,"" or denied the same thing as couples or larger groups. Just give me a smaller portion, fine by me. 

Regardless, my tacos were delicious and the chips and salsa were, too. 

Overall, I'd visit El Jefe's again. The design was cute, food was good, cocktails strong, and once I got their attention - the staff was friendly and attentive.",11/18/2021 3:12
_yQERMY15jwEKaG8U2LlnQ,1,"Im usually not the type of person to write reviews, but my experience with this practice was one for the books. Unfortunately, 0 stars was not an option so I had no other choice but to give 1 star. I came to this practice to get fitted for orthotics. I was personally told by Jennifer Berlin that my insurance ONLY covers orthotics if I am a diabetic (which I am not a diabetic) and that I need to pay almost $500 for orthotics directly to the office. I personally called my insurance company to verify if this information was accurate, which was not the case. The insurance company informed me that I DO NOT HAVE TO BE A DIABETIC to get orthotics. I called the office back to inform them of my conversation with the insurance company along with providing them with a reference number. The girl Danielle who I guess is the office manager, who felt the need to tell me that she's been in the medical field for 12 years (irrelevant), basically said that she is not going with what the insurance company is telling me since its not accurate info and that I need to pay them 100% of the cost. I find this absolutely insane that this practice refused to go through my insurance company for orthotics and they are even in network with my insurance company!! Total scam and money hungry people. Don't waste your time going here if you have insurance :) Oh and not to mention, the attitude of the staff here is extremely unprofessional.

Webster says:

This company has redeemed itself by handling real problems with real solutions!

Based on the company's response to my previous review,  it is crystal clear that they have taken my problems seriously. Thank you! I received a reply from their business manager,  then their district manager and ultimatey,  the owner.  They were all prompt and helpful,  but the owner was exceptionally thoughtful and concerned for me, the customer, instead of just covering their behinds or giving me the corporate run around, he took the feedback and is using it to remedy any internal problems. Honestly,  that's all I could ever ask of a business, to be open to hearing a customer's perspectiveand to take appropriate action. So refreshing.  If all owners took things this seriously, I would be blown away and I am a former business consultant who knows how challenging that can be for owners and mangers to accept the feedback.  So, if you have any concerns or problems,  don't let them fester, contact this company because of 2 words: they care.  That's a rare thing. 

I don't expect much during a Pandemic,  but I do know money can be tight and PMR can be a real help.

Here's what's not fine: this places smells like shit. No really, it smells like shit because the dogs (and they are great dogs, don't get me wrong) that hang out in the place use it as their personal piss pad. This is well known; in fact, there's a sign that encourages patrons to beware of possible poop. But the urine... the mildew... the utter amount of just crap.

qSTp1iN00cF6jJA7H5NOOg,1,"Let me start with the ONE and only good with this complex... Judy! Judy has a great attitude and is really helpful. She is a great asset to this property. 

Now the bad... the manager of this property needs an attitude adjustment. One thing I can say is that if she hates her job so much, leave so she can stop being miserable, and making everyone miserable. This property is poorly managed. Windows and doors are not properly insulated so bugs tend to creep their way in to the apartment. It's a constant problem that they don't seem to care about. Next issue I have is the kids running around the complex like animals. There were several occasions where I almost hit a kid because they simply run out on to the street with no care at all. Next is the parking. If you have a nice car, be prepared to have plenty of dings on your door and a lot of scratches. Another parking issue I have is tenants/visitors tend to park wherever they fell like. If you are on the back side of the complex, between buildings B & C, cars constantly park in front where it is a red zone. God bless the maintenance guy whom I've seen sticking warning stickers on windshield. It tends to stop for a few days, then people start parking thagain. I will attach an example of how considerate these people are. (For example, that van either parks on that road or next to the mustang parked in the handicap, who doesn't ever seem to leave). 

Units are mediocre at best. I will definitely leave this property once my lease is up. My suggestion is, don't make this your permanent ""home."" However, if you're in a financial crunch or would like to save money, this will serve its purpose. 

If you decide to live here, deal with Judy. She's very helpful. IMO, she should be running this place. I'm sure there will be significant improvements.",7/16/2017 1:01
dQaHqpAV-nJHm-gysC6YOw,1,"On Friday (3/8) afternoon, I went to the shelter to see a puppy named Cisco. When I got there I went to the front, but was told to go to the back if I wanted to see a dog. No problem. 

When I get to the back, I speak to Susie and explain my situation. 

We were looking for a companion for our dog, Luna, who was once used as a bait dog and struggles with anxiety. She needed a dog friend. 

I didn't hide Luna's history and I showed photos to Susie which showed her lack of fur and scarred appearance. Susie agreed Cisco would be a great option for us because of his calm and easy going nature. I asked if we could bring Luna in the morning to meet with Cisco. She agreed enthusiastically.

Next morning, I walk in and Cisco is covered in dried mud. We got there not long after they opened meaning he probably had that mud on him all night. 

Susie isn't there so I found another woman (blonde) and explain what I discussed with Susie. She and the brunette back there were clearly annoyed I was there. I asked if we could do the meet and greet in the front office's waiting room due to our dog being previously abandoned and we didn't want her to think we were going to leave her. We were denied. They bring Cisco out, in the rain, and as soon as the first woman saw our dog all of her walls went up.

We are completely fine with questions regarding our dog. They are understandable. We are happy to answer questions and provide examples if need be. We also understanding needing to be on your guard during meet and greets. However, the way the looked at and treated our dog was unacceptable.

Luna is obviously nervous but it isn't because of the puppy. It's because of the environment. 

Please note: Luna is mainly ignoring the puppy and not once did she show any aggression. 

The blond woman begins to imply our dog may bite the puppy even though Luna is clearly staying focused on staying with my husband.  We tell her that's never happened and we have a firm handle on her regardless. Despite this, for the next 30 minutes we continue to hear about how we ""just never know"" and about how our dog has the potential to be violent. I wonder if they'd do that if it was a scarred up lab or golden retriever? I doubt it. 

 A brunette wouldn't stop glaring at Luna and even had the audacity to ask if Luna had ""ever even been AROUND puppies?!"" in a hateful, short, accusatory voice while looking at Luna like she's a monster. Luna had puppies herself. 

As soon as they saw Luna, they made their decision on our approval status and they made it very clear. 

During the whole meet and greet, the blonde told multiple stories to try prove ""we just never know"" because she lacked the social grace to realize enough was enough (even after we expressed our frustration at her continuous accusations). She even told a story about how she found out her ""sweet"" dog was racist. Dogs reflect the prejudices of their owners so we found that interesting. She even used a story regarding a dog that'd been clearly overbred to make a point that Luna could suddenly attack. It was unbelievable. The lack of social intelligence was staggering. 

We get the concern (and I'm sure their reaction wasn't meant to be hateful or personal), but they made it clear they believed us naive and it was only a matter of time before ""Luna snapped"". Like we would endanger a puppy for the sake our own desires. The vibes made the whole thing awkward and awful. Dogs can sense that so of course Luna was afraid. I would be too if I had two women looking at me like that. 

I expressed my concerns regarding their behavior to a woman upfront who tried to act like they were just stressed and that they are one of the few to rescue puts (wrong - most adoption places do now - the fact you even see that as a badge of honor is a problem because pits shouldn't be viewed as extra special cases or more dangerous ones). I was met with what felt to be empty apologies and weak excuses. We left and found a perfect puppy at the Humane Society of Sumner County. The people there were incredible and kind. 

This was our first experience with our sweet Luna being looked at like she was a monster. Everyone who knows her loves her. 

Please see attached photos of new puppy (Remus) and our ""dangerous""  Luna - one photo is her and a tripod cat whose her bestie.  

I'm sure the dog will find a good home, but the way they spoke to us and acted towards our dog was beyond terrible. 

TL;DR: the people at this place have no social grace or manners. They make you feel like a burden and judge dogs based on appearance and act like they are the only ones who know much about dogs to the point of acting like they know YOUR dog better than you do...I'm sure they have saved many lives, but they need better bedside manner and kinder volunteers. 

Thank you",3/11/2019 22:49

They are same group of people to do the cheating I guess!
This is my experience, hopefully will save you out of my situation and save you the money too!!
Got the fridge fixed, and  was told need time to cool, on second day, found totally not working.
Called the number on receipt, was told the customer service will call back in 24 or 48 hours.
Two days passed, no calls. Called again, same answer, so I asked customer service number and called, no answer. So I have to wait, another 4 days passed, nobody called. Called the number on receipt again, was told will let customer service call me in 24 or 48 hours. Wait another 4 days, still nobody called.  The fourth time I called again,  didn't know the lady who answered the phone is same person or not, so every time I have to explain my situation again, and this time after my explaining, she quickly asked my name and told me she just filed my file minutes ago, I knew immediately she was totally lying. 
Feel so frustrated, they even gave me a call, even call me to tell me maybe two parts were broken at same time and they just fixed one will let me feel much better. 
So now I'm sure, this company was totally cheating. 
You only get quick response when you call to fix the appliances. 
Then a cheater appear and fix, told you the fridge need time to cool, take the money and left.
Not working? Call the number again? The answer always will call you back in 24 or 48 hours and never call you again.

Just right after I posted the above reviews, I got a call said he from customer service and said the person worked in customer service before was quit and he just took this position few days ago. Will let the person to check in next couple of days.  I'll keep posting to see what's going on.",3/15/2016 19:59

cT90phDGL9wrmNfRKIGTlg,2,"I was in town and needed a place to meet a friend. This place fit the bill the food was tasty and if I just ranked this based on food it would be 4 or 5 stars. 

Walking in, the employees get in your face and yell a greeting. Even pre-pandemic that would have been weird, but now it was too much. People here are complaining about the level of music but it seemed to fit the ambiance for dinner. We were there at lunch and it was still fine (though I was surprised). We were able to get a table by the window because we were the only ones wearing a mask, including the servers. 

Prices are steep but expected. The candied bacon cost more than a dollar a strip. The truffle fries are $$ but have truffle oil so they were amazing, and worth 5 stars alone. I took my leftovers home and ate them for breakfast with a fried egg on top.  

Our server didn't ask how we wanted our burgers cooked and they arrived medium. I hate seeing pink in ground meat, so I was able to eat everything except the center, which I would have liked to have eaten. Not because it was extra delicious but because I was hungry. I should have just finished the fries and ordered a milkshake instead of a burger. 

This place has potential but since I'm only in Boise once every two years, I won't be back.

ogUfd9OwxegyXCBrtFVHyQ,1,"I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, as per the multiple reviews referring to Muskan's horrible attitude and customer service, they are right. 

It was my first time here and I made an appointment with Muskan through Vagaro. An elderly woman did them and I liked them. What I didnt know was that it was Muskans MOTHER who came out and did my eyebrows, despite me making my appointment with Muskan. Since it was my first time going there, I didn't know. It was also never mentioned to me that her mom would be doing my eyebrows instead. 

I made another appointment a month later with Muskan, and a lady who I didnt recognize came out to greet me. Obviously I was confused, because she wasn't who did my eyebrows before, but it was *the real* Muskan who did my eyebrows this time. 

Truthfully, she did a bad job on my brows. They were uneven and left a lot of hair. She also asked very uncomfortable questions and kept making jokes about how she messed up my eyebrows. It was all very odd. 

I let her know about my confusion and how no one told me that her mother would be the one doing my eyebrows. I'm not a confrontational person and was just letting her know that I was caught off gaurd, and that if I knew it was her mom who did my eyebrows first, I would have made an appointment with her mom again. She got VERY defensive and VERY unprofessional, and later called me twice to let me know not to come back.

_KlqjEc6dQLsvnEKUO7guQ,5,"After nearly a week of outstanding New Orleans food, the bar was pretty high to meet or certainly exceed what I've had as my gastronomical experience in the city. Gris-Gris succeeded on all counts. 

On a busy Friday night we had a wonderful table outside next to the fountain. Being early December we were a bit concerned about the chill in the air, but it was unseasonably warm so it made the evening enjoyable.

The service was outstanding, but it was the food that was the star. From the starters...the Oyster Pie, sporting plumb and juicy poached oysters in a cream sauce with leeks and artichokes with a generous helping of whipped potatoes....to the house salad that had a wonderful creole mustard vinaigrette... to the entrees, the extraordinary Mississippi Rabbit Fricassee, which served braised in the holy trinity (that wonderful New Orleans base) along with Louisiana popcorn rice, a long and aromatic rice with a side of the most delicious blackened sweet corn bread was incredible. 

To top things off, the pecan bread pudding (a la mode!) was shared by our group as we were truly and happily stuffed.

My gosh, did this change abruptly when I visited Santa Barbara Auto Group and was nicely greeted by Jimmy Triese and said what I had always said in the past I'm just looking around. He said great and not once approached me again. I did find a car I liked and wanted to check the Carfax report, etc. and called him the following day asking if the car was still available. It was and with a no pressure approach he just said you'ret welcome to test drive if you ever decide you would like to. I met with him the next day and he handed me the keys and encouraged me to take a 20 minute+ drive as this would likely give me enough time to get a feel for the car. It's truly the only time I've never had pressure put on me by a car salesman and fortunately the car was one I thoroughly enjoyed. Jimmy handled the rest of the purchase journey quickly and easily for me. 
It was a wonderfully unexpected, no pressure, experience.

knwK1zwTWQylqEvGkVWzog,1,"The one star is for the sweet assistant who did my teeth cleaning. 
This was an office I found online, is close to home and accepts my insurance. I have a chipped molar (#31) that has become infected and needed to see the dentist ASAP. They got me in, racked my insurance for X-rays of my entire mouth, despite the current X-rays I brought of the tooth. That should have been my first clue but I was in pain and my teeth are in bad shape so I overlooked it, hoping to get my cracked tooth fixed or removed. 
He gave me antibiotics and pain meds and the lovely assistant cleaned my teeth. 
After looking at my X-rays, Dr. Kopp was almost judgmental about the condition of my teeth and spoke to me in a tone that can only be described as condescending. I freely admitted right away that I had neglected my teeth for a bit and that certain medications I had been prescribed, also took their toll. 
He was quiet, non communicative, and just looked at my X-rays, told me I have a few cavities and also need some root canals..... very vague.....so I had to pry the info from him like which teeth, what was covered, etc etc. 
I scheduled the extraction of the cracked tooth, and granted, it really hurts, but I waited two weeks. That morning they called and cancelled me because the doctor ""had a head cold"". 
So I then rescheduled.....3 weeks later, still in pain, out of antibiotics at this point and I get a phone call two hours prior to my appointment to say that the doctor has decided I need to see a dental surgeon for my extraction and would not be removing my tooth. 
*** Mind you, online it says they do oral surgery***
He could have told me this from the beginning and I could have had the tooth removed five times over by now but instead, I waited, trusted the doctor, gave him the benefit of the doubt with his ""head cold"" non sense all while being in pain, that escalates daily due to the infection. 
That is not very good ethics, or bedside manor as far as I am concerned. He let me go on and suffer while awaiting services promised by their office that were never provided. 
Steer clear of this facility, they are out to charge up insurance plans and if you aren't a big money investment, they will invest no time on your dental needs.

Feather pillows were nice touch as well as the fact the room was wired play music throughout from our ipod. 

Hotels rooms are so hit or miss in NOLA because of the hard wear and tear they get and the damp air year round.

I ended up not getting anything other than coffee.

- Vietnamese egg coffee (5/5), never had this before and upon reading the description, thought it would be very sweet. We asked for less of the egg and milk blend and was pleasantly surprised how well balanced it was. After blending the coffee with this egg/milk blend the sweetness subdued significantly. This is coming from a person who thinks traditional Vietnamese coffee with the condensed milk could be way too sweet as I'm used to drinking coffee black.

- Vietnamese drip coffee (4/5), we ordered both a hot and cold version. I recommend the hot version. To be honest, I thought the coffee was too acidic for my liking.

Sheesh, my Mid-City Rouse's can't hold a candle to the selection of hot food and deli food that this one has. I got so excited I think I bought enough food for like multiple lunches and dinners! Unfortunately I'm not a hobbit so some of this may end up getting frozen! Hehe

Some of my bounty from the hot food included red beans and rice with sausage, lasagna and meatloaf (ok I'm Asian so meatloaf still fascinates me!). And from the behind the glass part I got the seasoned salmon and the skirt steak with bell peppers and onions!

I also bought the Gentilly Berry cake (Rouse's take on the Whole Foods Berry Chantilly cake which is my all time favorite cake, probably bc I hate sweet icing and it's a perfect balance of cake, fruit and not super sweet icing) for my friend to celebrate her new job!

I supplied a sink model number (under-mount), showed them the sink, showed them the faucet (as instructed). He said it was an over-mount sink, despite my initial remnant order being for an under-mount cut, and I trusted that they knew what they were talking about and maybe I ordered something different months previous. I also trusted that since I gave them the sink model number and cutting template, they would figure out the final cut correctly. It was cut incorrectly for my sink. Sink replacement = $1400+2 months, counter = $910.

I was stuck and just had to take a new counter, which they supplied for 50% the original cost (what a deal??) despite no new template being required, just a new remnant and install. In the end, I believe they still made money on the new counter despite them being somewhat at fault for the incorrect cut. They are a business and could have written it off.

Every time I've shopped here for myself or with others, I leave feeling like I've found more than what I thought I needed (great for any gardener to feel that happiness and this was certainly true on my most recent visit). 

If you're looking for seeds, plants, ready to eat veggies & fruit, various garden maintenance items, home & garden accessories or decor items, this is a great place to shop. If you're on a time or budget limit, you might need to go in with someone else to help you focus and cover more ground. There's always a lot to look at and if you go often enough, there's even a stamp card to fill up (I won't go into the details, as another yelper explained that really well already). 

The last visit I'm recalling (in Aug 2021), I noticed they had a decent discount on remaining vegetables, herbs and flowers for your garden. To a point it distracted me from my original mission of buying veggies for my upcoming meals. Well only a little... as I bought some lovely mature herbs of basil, stevia and chives to add to my patio garden. I stocked up on the veggies I went there for but made a note to myself about the cases of BC fruit. I'm writing this review now as I forgot it in drafts and found it again when sharing this location with relatives and friends. Most recently my Aunt picked up potatoes from there (Oct 2021), so the food area is still available as well as all the neat extra things closer to the tills.

Parking lot is large enough one wouldn't struggle to find a spot, it's flat and it's paved. The entrance/exit is both flat, making it welcoming for all levels of mobility. 

The signs could be a bit more strategically placed so one actually goes into the right greenhouse area for plants, types of flowers, veggies & fruit (fruits & veggies were at the far end of the connecting greenhouses but in the past years the veggies & fruit were close to the exit & tills). 

I also passed a lot of staff in the greenhouse but no one asked me if I was finding what I was looking for, if needed help with anything I was looking at or if I knew that they were closing up soon. It wasn't until I reached the till I realized what time it was with all the staff gathered near the exit waiting for the greenhouse to close. That was an odd feeling but I appreciate the cashier & what I assume was the owner for still taking time to chat with me and make sure I knew about the punch card and had everything I needed. 

While exiting, I noticed a bunch of very happy greenhouse cats and one very lovely old greenhouse dog. Something about greenhouse that keep animals always makes me smile just a bit more.",11/22/2021 4:30

I've gone to great salons all over the Tampa area but never in St Pete before. There is no receptionist here so you are greeted by whoever is doing your lashes that day. It's not the most professional environment. The girl who was doing my lashes was blasting awkward cursing rap music. Not so relaxing but I didn't care too much and brushed it off. It took almost 3 hours to do my lash set which is longer than I'm used to. 

Throughout many times my lashes burned and once we were done and she showed me the set I couldn't open my right eye because there was glue on the inner corner which burned badly. I let her know and she cut it off. It looked pretty and not completely even on both sides but I was still happy. 

Their Instagram page promises a retention of 3-4 weeks. After one week more than half of my lashes came off, I messaged the owner to let them know and all she did was offer 10 dollars off of a fill. Why would I get a fill from here again!? these lashes last a week! I paid over $100 because I didn't do their $59 special since those are done by technicians who are learning and just graduated from training. No thanks! 

So disappointed by this as I wasted my hard earned money. I know the discounted rate is tempting because I fell for it too but if you're reading this DO NOT do it. It's not a nice, pampering salon experience and at the end of the day these lashes last a week. What's the point? Better to pay a little more and actually have good lashes without glue stains that will actually last you for a month. Very disappointed.",3/24/2019 20:10

It's more grab and go, but they do have a few tables to sit at for your meal. I got the banh mi, which was good - but I wish it was more filling. There was just something left to be desired. The customer service was decent, but nothing remarkable. I'll be back if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. The ""small and nichey gourmet sandwich shop"" is not as strong as it is in other cities, but this one falls in the middle of the pack.",12/4/2021 15:32

In a tiny strip center behind a tiny strip center off of Rte 70 in Cherry Hill this has some of the best cheesesteaks around. The place is a zero thrills place with only a few tables but the people are friendly and the food damn good. Neither of us were starving but the buns were so damn soft, the meat so tender we gorged and did not regret the inevitable ten minute walk up to the second floor and home (the donuts after also didn't help).

The parking lot was so poorly laid out, we actually circled the building once entirely, ended back out on a crowded street, and had to come back in a second time. We eventually parked in probably what was someone else's lot to be honest, but they sort of run together. The crowd was pretty quickly dispatched, but unfortunately, there was no coffee ... neither dark roast, or the light dish water stuff. I mean none. The entire time it took me to choke down my meal, no coffee. I tried to tell someone twice, but still no dice. Panera sold me coffee and didn't deliver... I feel abused.",11/12/2015 20:51

This venue fills up rather fast.
Great gift shop, roomy and lots of choices of different items..
The acoustics are good.
Close parking spots are hard to find, Be prepared to walk far. They need more handicapped spaces.

It's not your traditional home style C&W, but has an over easy egg on top with the perfect combo of sweet and salty. They always have rotating specials, but stick to the OG dishes. This is my favorite brunch spot in Philly--multiple locations, but this one I've frequented the most. Make sure you account for wait times on weekends--it's always at least a 30 min wait.

Not only did they moved all our stuff so swiftly, but these actual gentle giants have such a great amazing sense of humor and also are so happy and positive. They handled our stuff with amazing great care. We had Slaven and James as our movers, and I want to express how much appreciate them! 

Because of our time constraint and a lot of little hiccups we've had with the city and getting permits at the last minute, they made it super easy for us and made time for us when they didn't really need too since it was really my fault. 

If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would do it in a heart beat. Please hand your business to them. You will not be disappointed at all!!

y_4Us9aQzEjeLkyvzULcrQ,2,"(ST's food will always get 5 stars from me for being fresh and original.  This 2-star review is based solely on this location alone.  I live in St.Pete with no ST close to me.  This ST location is always such a jam-packed, chaotic, circus of a line-waiting and noisy ""adventure,"" that my family just prefers to make the drive and dine at the ST in Palm Harbor...)

I'm a proud carnivore and the nearly-meatless Sweet Tomatoes may still be my favorite chain restaurant in our area!

It is a bit pricey for a soup/salad bar/bakery buffet, but I think it is well worth it for the quality and selection.  Check your Sunday paper ads for a coupon.  It helps a bunch.

The pre-assembled salad creations are great and the make-your-own salad selection is likely the most expansive you've ever seen.  I would eat a salad like this every day if I had enough energy to prep the ingredients.

But it is their Yankee Clipper clam chowder that keeps me coming back, over and over.  It is a magical, creamy delight, with lots of clams and french-fry-sized pieces of potato.

I like to grab a piece or two of their great parmesan focaccia to DIP (when nobody is looking, of course!).

Their chicken noodle soup is also very well done, with giant pieces of shredded chicken and chunky, homestyle noodles.

The bakery offerings are always excellent.  The cornbread and blueberry muffins definitely earned their ""black belts,"" and could compete and win with any bakery dojo!

My only food complaint?  Eh...  The pasta?  Seems to be just cooked noodles, tossed in a sauce in a wok?  For shame!  REAL macaroni and cheese is born from an oven!  You know, with the cheesy and CRUSTY top?  You start doing that here and you will win over many more fans!

I will always love ST and am hoping they will finally open a location in St. Pete!  Until then I will avoid the never-ending chaos here and drive a bit more North!",9/2/2015 9:17

I will admit that the location is pretty cool being able to sit outside and overlook Lake Tarpon but the view just can't overcome the go-hum food, in my opinion. There are a couple of things that are okay on the menu but as rich as this area is in awesome restaurants, there are just other places I'd rather go.

I know a lot of people have given this restaurant some really high reviews so this is one you just need to go and decide for yourself.

When we arrived, we were told about the drink specials and ordered a couple of their recommended beers.

We ordered the jackfruit taquitos and the jackfruit burrito and they were both DELISH!  We had the vegan ""Teese"" and vegan ranch dressing with the taquitos, and you could barely tell that they were vegan options.  

It's a cool spot with arcade games and a cool atmosphere.  The only sport they play on television is hockey, so don't come here for the Sunday football game.

Maybe it's because I'm from the west coast but I felt like that it's pretty expensive for 4 tacos, side chips, and beans.

Obviously if you're not a fan of smoking, then this place isn't for you. I'm personally not a big smoker myself, but my boyfriend and I had a wonderful time sharing a cigar here. They have a large assortment of cigars displayed in glass cases stretched along the side of the room. Since there is a great variety in price, you have the option to select something cheaper if you're not willing to spend much or you can buy something much more expensive depending on your taste. Once you've purchased your cigar, you can head on over to the other side of the lounge to the bar where you can purchase beverages ranging from simple espressos to beers and sangria. My boyfriend and I chose to pair our cigar with their homemade sangria and we were not disappointed! Afterwards, you can sit outside and people watch on Ybor or you can choose to sit inside the lounge on their nice leather couches and chat with company or watch sports.

The breakfast menu is pretty intriguing, with a handful of savory dishes and some over the top sweet ones. I couldn't keep my eyes off the cookie dough french toast, so ended up having to order it. I wasn't upset by that at all. It definitely had the cookie dough flavor you'd expect, and wasn't overly indulgent like I thought it might be. 

My friend agreed to split with me so we could try a couple of options, so we also got the salted caramel banana stuffed french toast. That one was a miss, imo. I ended up not even finishing it because it just didn't really work out well with the flavors or the layered bananas that kept making it slide over.

I probably should have gotten the tofu scramble, one of the few vegan options on the menu, but my sweet tooth took over today. Don't regret it, but probably won't do it again.",12/19/2021 2:11

I love the variety of muffin flavors available; Chocolate chip, blueberry, cinnamon crunch to name a few.  The bagels are outstanding, the cream cheese is smooth, and they offer a variety of flavors in both of those as well. 
In the past I really enjoyed stopping by for their daily breakfast special.  It usually consisted of a cup of coffee and either a muffin or breakfast sandwich.  My favorite combo was a selection of mini muffins and a cup of coffee.  Bite-sized versions of their moist and delicious muffins and a cup of Brewster's coffee in French Velvet Creme...sooo good.  
This location is always clean and the staff are friendly and helpful.

Tria was actually an accidental find for my boyfriend and I. We were wondering around looking for a place to eat on a Sunday afternoon when we walked by it and decided to go. Best unintentional win ever.

WHAT I GOT: Breakfast flatbread with a side of potatoes
WHAT HE GOT: Duck scrapple with a side of bacon

PROS: Portion sizes are pretty hefty so you'll be eating your money's worth in delicious, perfectly cooked food. My breakfast flatbread was loaded with bacon and potatoes all stacked on top of a melted bed of a herb cheese mixture. Absolutely delicious. My boyfriend got the duck scrapple, not knowing what to expect since this was his first time having scrapple. He's not a fan of the texture or the taste too much but paired with the perfectly poached egg Tria serves with it and their amazing beer-naise sauce, the dish is doable. He absolutely fell in love with their bacon though. Aside from their brunch menu, their regular menu options are also delicious. My boyfriend is an avid fan of the beer burger. We usually always go when there's not that many people so the atmosphere is quite nice. Cozy and intimate. The waiters are also extremely friendly and super accommodating.  

CONS: Some of their menu options are a tad overpriced but the quality of the food redeems that a bit.",2/5/2017 5:46

So for instance, a dining room area, living room, that kind of thing. Everywhere you look you're just looking through organized items. 

When I walked in I was immediately greeted by the two workers. They were so friendly and explained a bit of the place since I hadn't been there before. They even thanked me for coming in on such a cold day; even offered me a drink! Such great customer service in my book. 

The record section was absolutely amazing!! So many good finds in there. I honestly didn't have enough time to see the whole place. That's how great it was and how much stuff is there to look at. They seriously have it all. 

As I was about to leave because it was close to the closing time, the men even encouraged me to stay. They said they'd be there after close and I didn't have to rush off if I didn't want to.

The cuts of meat are great quality, but that's where it all ends. I asked for medium well done on mine, and it was red and bleeding inside. I had to microwave it.

They didn't have the one we wanted in stock, and even though we needed something quick and they wouldn't be able to deliver/install until the following week, we wanted to support a local business... so we went with Gerhard's--especially since they promised to get it here ASAP. Big mistake. 

We were told by the sales person that we pay our service person when they are here to install. Install day comes around, my husband stays home from work to let them in--day before we're scheduled to have this baby--and they don't put it on the truck because we're told we needed to pay the day before, and there's no way to get it before.

We regret not going with Lowes or Home Depot, as we could have had a dishwasher several days before, at the beginning of the week. Additionally, after calling throughout the day to talk to the sales person or get information from ANYBODY, we were consistently blown off by their staff with the promise of calling us ""right back"" in a few minutes, and never hearing from them until we called again.

The entrees soon followed and while also properly prepared there was nothing really special about them.  Prices were good,  we paid around $60.00 for dinner and two cocktails.  Wait staff quickly cleared the table once we were finished, but took a while to bring the check and the server  immediately took off even as I was trying to hand him the credit card.

Family owned and operated since 1986, Leo and Devon (and their awesome team), are simply the best at what they do. They are hardworking, honest, and always do what's in the interest of their customers. 

Tire Century has consistently performed accurate and reliable diagnostics on my truck. Not only that, but they have such reasonable repair prices and are quick and efficient. They do what they promise, every time. If they tell you your oil change will be a half hour, it will be a half hour, every time. If they aren't sure what's going wrong, they will tell you. You get the idea. 

They are exactly the people you want to hand your automobile over to. If you are someone who knows little about cars and dreads being taken advantage of, this is the place to bring your car. They take the time with every customer, no matter how knowledgeable they may or may not be, to explain what is going wrong and what solutions look like. No ultimatums or pressure, just low-key people making a living doing what they are so good at, auto-everything. 

Leo and Devon, thank you so much for running a trustworthy car business in Saint Louis City!

- 1st call: asked to place an order for delivery and was put on hold, but they dropped the line. 

- 2nd call: ordered two 'za: one sausage, one plain. Before I could ask how long and if they take card or just cash, they hung up on me. You'd think they'd provide that info ...

- 3rd call: told them I just placed an order for delivery but had some questions. They confirmed the order, and once again promptly hung up before I could get another word in!!

Now this was just absurd! 3 calls and they couldn't bother to provide you with any of the basic info. So not knowing what to expect, I scrambled to collect enough cash and just waited around, along with 4 hangry men who just spent all day performing physical labor.

Approx. 40mins later, the food was here, and man oh man I have never seen a sadder looking pizza. Chuck e Cheese put this greasy, listless pile of dough and cheese to shame.

Also, I'm a little peeved at Schnucks and how their downtown Culinaria is chipping away at the foundation of other downtown stores. Picked Shop 'n Save this week instead, even if it is a little further away than Culinaria.

If you are looking for canned food or pasta, Shop 'n Save is great. And  inexpensive. They also offer some good prices on meat (which I love) and cereal (for the BF). The shelves and aisles are clean enough and the bagging area is usually stocked/ready for use.

However if you are looking for fresh produce, Shop 'n Save is not the place! Also, if you live with a lactard and require fancy milk, Shop 'n Save doesn't carry it. And it's tough to find help when you need it...

Would I go there again? Probably. I like exploring options beyond Schnucks and Dierbergs in the area while saving a few bucks at the same time. If I need fresh produce I'll just run by the Soulard Market on my way to work or on a Saturday afternoon.",11/16/2009 0:52
FILUmFX4fueKJdnHhjadag,4,"This should be a 3.5 star review, but I rounded up since Yelp did not have the option  

The food at this venue is very well made and honestly comes out pretty quickly if the food is ready. The venue is clean and has a very ""small pub"" feel to it (not unsimilar to Finns Mccool down the street). It's charming and cozy above all else. 

The staff, from my experience, is very hit or miss. My first time here we had a very welcoming young lady who  served us really nicely. The second time, we had a young man who seemed both rude and aloof to basic conversational skills. There is nothing wrong with this, as I was not offended, however this needs to change if you expect to grow your reputation as a restaurant in the area. People will not always find this appealing (if at all). 

Lastly, I wanted to touch on the food situation. We arrived after the lunch rush and it seemed that the staff needed about one hour to get wings and burgers ready; they had literally none. This is already a logistical nightmare for a restaurant that opens all day, but what really surprised me was the staffs inability to keep people here at all. I saw 5 parties of people come and leave while my lady and I decided to wait and ate fries to mull over the wait time.  This should not happen, in my opinion. Offer the guests a discount, complementary sides to wait, maybe a free drink too?.... But keep them at your venue! You've effectively made even a discounted sale into nothing and thus have shown those people your inability to serve food at certain times of the day, as well as the inability to retain customer satisfaction.

6XhemL5EkY2pT0Lnwodm6A,5,"I just moved to Philadelphia from Miami, so I know my share of good and bad restaurants/lounges. I received a friend request from Shouk Lounge on MySpace and thought it looked like a cool place. So my roommates and I went to have dinner, drinks, and of course, a hookah. 

As soon as we got there, I immediately liked the decor and feel to the place. Its dimly lit with tons of candles. They have a bunch of art hanging on the wall, the music was a good selection of things I don't normally listen to, but like none the less. 

We ordered Israeli fries and these lentil fritters which were really good, but above all else, their Moroccan martini is AMAZING! If you come here, you MUST give it a try. I am not a martini person, but I was won over with this one. For dinner I had this steak with a thick olive paste on it which was really really good. If you like olives, you will love this! For our hookah, we ordered the melon flavor which was great and not very smoky to inhale... I'm not a smoker, but smoking out of a hookah was fun. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped us out with this whole hookah thing, since we were all new to it.  

If you are looking for a nice romantic date place, Shouk is also great. If you and your date are ok with the smell of smoke and being around it, I would definitely recommend it! I have been back to Shouk many times to have drinks with friends, and I always order my Moroccan martini!

I give it 5 stars!! *****

The best part is the use and reliance on regional, heritage wheats and grains, grown on local farms (""15 miles away"") and ground by a local mill, using slow-rising, sour-dough type yeasts.

0Cwus8T5TL7AqKa3iAqyFw,4,"It's stitll a hit of 4 stars and that's pretty much close to perfection. I could not go to any italian restaurant (yet) in the area because i think of mangia. I have eyes to other italian restaurants but mangia give me the reason to come back. Tonight is its grand opening of the new extension of dining seats. To celebrate this event, I ordered the mangia house special of pasta specialities for the first time. I like the taste as usual. However, pasta is not homemade but by Barilla or supermarket noodles and tomato sauces. People who eat here are patrons and from the area. Customers talk to each other from across/near seats and express satisfaction to mangia's service but most specially, it's food. And the best of all is the reasonableness of the food price. I hope though that if price change, it won't be drastic increase or would remain the same. The dining facility is quite simple, not elegant or sophisticated; it's a pizzeria style environment, but it works fine. Music is jazzy but too loud, and like the music you'll hear in chain Olive Garden. The lighting is adequate. The grand re-opening is an expansion of space, an extension of more seatings on the other side. There was a need for more seatings as customers come back and seatingare  close to each other.",10/24/2010 1:22
5O3VvfDu_HDvgUviAqmTEA,2,"After reading all of the positive reviews for Rise Pies on Yelp my husband decided to pick up a few pies for dinner tonight.

We tried the Margherita and the Hawaiian pizza and they were both terrible. The Margherita pizza was the better of the two, but this pizza was so salty. The Hawaiian pizza was barely edible and was covered in a sickening sweet barbecue sauce. The only positive thing I can say about the pizza is that the crust was amazing. The crust was super thin and perfectly chewy, but unfortunately we were not fans of the sauce.

I think I will stick with Grimaldi's if I am craving pizza.",1/13/2016 3:08
NsKJ7A1hSZ1XUdHui6bDSg,3,"Here is what I think.
For $200+ a night, it isn't worth it for a business trip.  If I'm here to party it may be, but it's all work and no real play.
Pros-
The staff is on point, they are  great! 
The rooms are spacious. 
They have a shuttle that runs every 30 minutes.
Cons-
Walls are thin, I can hear the man snoring in the room next to me.  I had to run the AC all night to drown them out because they were loud at night and then turn it lower when he woke me up with his snoring. 
Which leads me to needing extra blankets in the room, this thin blanket isn't enough.  
Or add ear plugs to the bathroom, which isn't unusual, as you can also hear the street traffic very well. 
I most likely won't be returning here, if I did it would be for your staff, they really are that great!",4/19/2018 9:28

I called them asking for an estimate on a windshield for my 2016 VW CC; they gave me good price and an appointment for my onsite installation. The installation day I got called and they were ""faking"" to be ready to come and install the windshield, but suprisingly they had the ""wrong"" car model, so they had to reschedule. I got reschedule by a very mean and nasty woman over the phone without any idea about phone etiquette or customer service. The new appointment day nobody showed up and nobody called. The hours they give are 8:00am to 5:00pm but they dont even care about calling you. I called them the next day, and the same nasty lady just told me they dont have the part and I have to go to the dealer. A whole week lost on this process and now I have to go to the dealer. This people should not schedule any appointment until the have the part; and the ones taking the phone calls definitely need some coaching. Thank you very much for nothing!!",4/7/2019 23:06
37ztQXVgezRc6qnYGp--hg,2,"VEGAN EATERS HERE.....To be honest, the tag might better read ""Should have been better"".  If you know me, there is no bigger fan of restaurants in general. I rarely write a bad review, I just don't say anything. This is something that needs saying and, there will be no photos this time.

We've been going to Mesa Verde for almost seven years now and at times considered it our favorite (V) restaurant on the Central Coast. The food was spectacular, the presentation was always equal to the food, the creativity and  thought given to each element of the eating experience was simply remarkable.

Then, a while back, things started to fail and yes, I'm taking into consideration covid19. The quality started getting spotty, the service erratic, the ambience less inviting and the food, always the mainstay was inconsistent.

While in Santa Barbara the other day we decided to take a chance and revisit for lunch. To be honest, we were simply stunned. The menu was much smaller and literally dirty, and the prices had jumped to an alarming degree. The vibe was so flat, the only welcome came from the busser.

We ordered the street tacos and the green bowl to share between us. The prices were shocking, both $22.00 nearly double the previous prices, the presentation was beyond lackluster with the tacos arriving on a plain white plate, not the wooden planks they used to use, no garnish, just three tacos which comes to over $7.00 each? 

The bowl wasn't much better but we figured we bought it so eat it. Both dishes were so salty as to be nearly inedible. We mentioned this to the server who shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Water was never refilled, no dessert offered, not that we would have ordered one at this point and, they range from $13-14.00 each. 

To say that Mesa Verde is no longer what it once was isn't even close to the disappointing experience. This place used to be a Mecca for vegans and non-vegans. The food/service/ambience/quality was remarkable. Now it is simply sad, even the restroom was dirty. 

I prefaced these comments by saying I am fully aware that Covid19 has created countless problems for restaurants, some have made it and some have not. Some have flourished and some have not which is the case here. It would take a lot to get us to return or bring any of the many friends and family we've introduced to MV over the years.

It gives me no joy to say any of this but it's not my restaurant, I have been a very good customer for many years so not one of the malcontents here who never even ate at a restaurant and gave it 1 star for not getting in. Nope. 

I sincerely hope they wake up and give up the ghost or pull it together. Everyone deserves better.",12/6/2021 2:09

I recommend sitting outside cause the sound of the Honda $h!t boxes driving by sound better than the speakers inside that are about to blow themselves off the wall. (This is coming from someone who runs a jack hammer all day and plays drums in a Norwegian death metal band.)
Food is pretty good. Cost more than it should based on the tiny portions, in my opinion. 
Beer is good but some taste the they have dish soup in them. I usually get plastered after two ipas even though I drink a 30 pack of miller light on a daily basis (prob high sugar content )

The second time was a bad experience. We reserved a table for a party of 8 for my husbands birthday. We arrived 5 mins before our reservations and we're told our table isn't ready yet but should be soon. After waiting for 40 mins, our table was finally ready. This put a damper on our plans for the rest of the night because we were sat so much later than we were promised. Everyone said the food was okay but they would not return because it wasn't anything special plus the service wasn't good. We asked if there's anything they could do to make up for us being sat late, they said there's nothing they could do... this further disappointed everyone.

8690gLMZkjXU3xzV-DObTA,5,"Between new dental insurance and some really bad experiences at other dental offices, I decided to try Aland Family Dentistry. I'm glad I did. I also really lucked out and receive my initial-new patient consultation and cleaning on the same day. 

The dental hygienist, dental techs, and his staff are super friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable. The tech taking my periapical xrays was really concerned and patient with my 'really bad gag reflex' and did everything she could to make the procedure as painless and as quick of a process as possible for me.  She didn't get viable annoyed when I kept involuntarily ""spitting out"" the film. Periapical xrays films are my mouth's kryptonite, so I really appreciated the techs' patience with me. 

The dental hygienist cleaning my teeth was very through in both her work and with discussing my 'problem areas' I need to address before my next cleaning, answering my questions, and giving me advice.

Lastly, Dr. Aland was the same as his staff - polite, profession and very informative. Unlike many dentist he didn't list a lot of work that needed to be done or recommend work - besides just getting back on a cleaning schedule and flossing. He made certain to answer all my questions. 

All-in-all a good visit. I'd recommend them. I've already booked my next cleaning with them.",1/5/2022 7:45

TtuLyYy4Gf41XA2JUQgY8A,3,"My boyfriend and I were getting on the turnpike and We needed food, so I said hey lets go to the tilted kilt. (Im a secure, trusting girlfriend). If you are not, don't bring your guy here. Their skirts do occasionally lift up or things of the sort when they pick stuff up ( they are real waitresses) . 
It's like Hooters, but a little classier. Thank god they weren't wearing tube socks. These waitresses (like their counterparts) go for the girl next door thing. They sit in the booth with you or at your table, very casual. I dont really like this whole sitting down with you thing at a restaurant. But hey, maybe men do and frankly, I'm not the tilted kilts demographic, men are. 

The draft list was extensive, a big plus for me. I would have tried one if I wasn't already wasted by the time we got here. So we just ordered wings and fries. They have some late night happy hour thing. So we got fries for $2 and an order of wings, full priced at $10.50 for 8 pieces. The wings were good, we got that sweet and spicy sauce, but we could have used more, especially for that price.  The fries were in a 16oz glass with a liner so not very much.

Finally did get through and reservations were kept as promised.  
This location is right next to Pastaria in the heart of Clayton.  Parking is just above the restaurant in the garage and YES they do validate parking!  
When you first walk in you think you're in VEGAS not a sushi restaurant.  Very modern and chic decor.  The customer's walking in were definitely dressed the Vegas part. Thank god I brought a change of clothes after running the 80's/90's Fun Run in Forest park that evening.  

We ordered almost everything on the menu and somethings twice.  
My only 2 complaints were 1) the sushi menu was a little difficult to follow.  The names rarely help you with what is in the roll, 2) Some of the portions were a little small.  
That being said the quality of the food was excellent.  The roll that stands out the most of course is the flaming Oh My God roll.  The fire added just the right amount of smokiness to the sushi that was quite unique.  
Overall an excellent place to dine on wonderful sushi and people watch!  Definitely dress up if you plan on dining on a Friday or Saturday night, as the ""pretty"" people definitely come here to be seen.",10/5/2015 3:55

After four nights of insomnia and headaches due to my back and neck pain I called H & J Spa and was able to schedule a 90 minute deep tissue massage for the next day. I'm always a bit nervous trying someone new but the massage I got was fabulous and just what I needed.

First the facility is very pleasant and clean, I felt immediately at ease. I was taken back to one of the massage rooms right away, given plenty of time to prepare, and I liked hearing a timer start at the beginning of the session (I've been to other places that cheat on time, one reason I avoid the big chain massage places that tend to overbook.) My massage therapist got right to work and used a variety of techniques to really work deep into my muscle knots, just the way I needed (and I could tell she could feel right where my worst spots were at). I really felt like I got the benefit of my full 90 minutes as she worked on everything from my scalp to my hands to my toes--with plenty of time on my aching back.

Their pricing is extremely fair and reasonable, and they will even give you a frequent visitor card where after 10 sessions you get one free. I will most definitely be going back and recommend them to others without hesitation!",5/15/2021 21:15

You almost can't feel guilty for eating anything here because everything is pretty healthy and good for you. I ordered the Key West Crepegg. Crepe with eggs, cheese, bacon, avocado, turkey, & some other stuff inside. I'm not even a fan of eggs nor savory crepes, but I was feeling healthily adventurous. I loved it! With a side of potatoes and an English muffin, the portion was just right. Not hungry, and not too full.

They already have pitchers of water and coffee on the table before you sit down. Since there is complimentary coffee while you wait, I assumed that the coffee already set on our table was also complimentary. Incorrect! We got charged for it. 

Funny that some of these reviews I'm reading praise the service. I thought our service was only ok. When we were ready for some boxes and the check, our server was nowhere to be found.

Which, if you love delicious, cinnamon foam this get the Cloud topping! I regretted not getting it with mine and I think it might be my new obsession. 
Next time I'm in the area, I'll definitely be stopping for some cloudage. 

They had some pastries on display, A cute area for Instagram worthy pics and lots of comfortable seating!

Each dish we had tickled my culinary imagination and opened new doors of spices and flavors.  


The food: We ordered a dozen raw oysters, beef tartare, and succotash.

Raw oysters with cucumber mignonette,fresh horseradish, and saltines. I never thought I would be putting cucumber anything on my raw oysters! OMG IT IS SO GOOD AND REFRESHING.  Seriously, if you like [or love] raw oysters you HAVE to check out The Franklin and have these. You will not be disappointed.

Beef Tartare.  Our waiter recommended this dish and I am so glad he did.  The tartare has pho garnishes mixed in and is served with a flaky, crispy puff.  Even though the server told us it did indeed have a familiar pho taste, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Sure enough it tasted like the sexy, delicious child of the world's best pho and beef tartare. Just a beautiful symphony/rave of flavors. 

 Spaetzle  Truly I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this dish.  I was delightfully impressed.  The dish consists of simply succotash and Parmesan. It had just the right amount of cheese and warmth. 


The environment  I will  just go ahead and say it. The Franklin is sexy.  Dim lit. Warm, relaxing colors. They have beautiful art including a large piece by Alyssa Monk (people submerged in water=sexy) and  a person in a full body cheetah print suit on a couch, gives it a touch of BDSM feel (again, sexy).

vpH9_9kaZYyrUgBfwkgYow,5,Randomly ordered from here on a Thursday night because I was too lazy to cook. Idk how I found out about this place but saw it had good reviews and it did not disappoint. Exceeded all my expectations and desires. Literally the best Indian ever. So happy it's only an 8 min walk away. How have we not discovered lazeez yet.... This is dangerous. I'll be back soon lol. The chicken tikka masala medium spice level was perfect. Thank you to the employee who helped us gauge the spice level. Samosa was also very good but the chicken was to die for. Quick pickup service. Well packaged and came home hot. Perfect. Fair pricing too for the city. And the quality was just too notch. There's only one other place who makes their sauce this creamy and delicious and it's a place we found in Pittsburgh years ago. THANK YOU FOR FINALLY GIVING ME MY FAVE INDIAN SPOT at home here in philadlephia. I can't wait to order again.... COME HERE NOW and you better order the chicken tikka masala if you know what's good for you. That is all. Literally fire.,10/15/2021 0:39

I took it back a second time for him to fix it and he had my bike 4 days, didn't touch the incorrect spacing but replaced the bearings and charged me another 200 to put Chinese bearings in. when I confronted him about the incorrect spacing he told me the active fork was bent. but I'm not sure what that has to do with mounting a wheel in the center of a front end, with proper geometry. stay away from this business, no pride or integrity here.",12/9/2019 13:10
djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,5,"Wow! Katie's, where have you been all my life? 

Actually, that's not completely true. I've eaten at Katie's before, but it was several years ago, right when they first opened up. I wasn't terribly impressed (back then my idea of ""good"" pizza was pepperoni and maybe olives) and didn't think to come back until just recently. 

Fast forward to Wednesday night. My gal pals and I just finished up a pedicure at Beautiful Nail and I used the handy Yelp iPhone app to find restaurants nearby. Katie's popped up and I remembered reading so many positive reviews about it, so why not give it another try?

I had completely forgotten how cute it is inside! The interior reminds me of someplace you'd visit that's not St. Louis... perhaps Chicago or LA. Some previous reviews mentioned bad service, but our waitress was awesome. She gave us plenty of time to pick out what we wanted to eat and even suggested a bottle of Chianti that would go well with our selection. 

Let me just say that their salads are to die for. Even if you're not a pizza lover, go here and order one of their many delicious leafy green options. One salad can easily be split between two people as an appetizer. We went for the beet salad, which had some of the best dressing I've had in a long time. 

For the main course, two of us split the roasted chicken pizza and my other friend had the four cheese pie. Both had a thin, crispy crust with fresh, hot ingredients on top. Hit the spot in so many ways! That was a lot of food for only three people, but we managed to eat almost everything served to us. 

I'm happy that Katie's was one of my last meals in STL - it was a perfect evening with my best friends. Glad that I have 'em another shot and that they blew it out of the park.",12/24/2010 16:14

2uzH6U_kGVOBIIJoZOOUPw,4,"I'm in love with the BBQ sliders (brisket, pork and chicken). They're moist and juicy and I just want to stuff my face with them every day, for every meal.

The dry-rub wings are tasty, too. They're $5 bucks at happy hour, and though you only get about five or six wings, they're not too skimpy. Plus, they taste the way I always want my chicken on the grill to taste--crispy, almost a little burnt, with a nice charred flavor and tender on the inside. While I fail at cooking (er, grilling), Betty's does not.

The sauce (Sam's Famous BBQ) used on the BBQ combo platter (1/4 chicken and 1/4 ribs) is sweet and tangy and so wonderfully finger-lickin' good. I'm definitely a fan of having to lick my fingers a million times after each bite of messy BBQ. Wet wipes are available, of course, but who wants to waste any last drop of sauce, even if it means lick-lick-licking away?

The macaroni salad is decent and the mac and cheese is oozy with a little bit of breadcrumb crunch on top. Both are worthy of thumbs up. The stuffing with gravy is just okay ... there was a flavor in there I couldn't quite pick out and I probably wouldn't order it again. And the buttermilk biscuit was quite dry. It tasted like someone went overboard with the flour and forgot about the butter. But! The rest of the menu looks promising (lots of interesting sandwiches and plenty of other sides). Must try more!

I wasn't drinking yesterday (huh?!) but the beer/wine/cocktail menu was similar to that of Devil's Alley--plentiful enough for drinkers across the board. The Smokin' Betty's Blonde and house wines were being offered for $3 during happy hour. I'm sure I'll be hittin' that up next time.

Oh, and I loved dining upstairs by the windows. Actually, the whole space is quite swank but in a non-glitzy way. Dark wood and lots of light. I could see it being a great spot for an event. Plus, the service (both hostess and servers) was friendly and attentive. Let's see if that sticks.

Yay and more yay! I hope this place does well because I'm looking forward to getting my BBQ on a lot more often this summer.

b39y_inQloddW6I49gV5AA,3,"Fergie's is a fine spot for some beers and grub, but on the pricey side.

The beer selection is okay with about half a dozen draft beers and about a couple of dozen bottled beers, including a few impressive hard-to-find brews.

The food is fine. The chilis, both meat and veggie, used to be standouts, but then they changed the cornbread recipe, and the dish didn't have the same kick.  Maybe they're rectified that; chefs change here so you never know.

On Tuesday and Thursday nights there' s quizo here, which is great.  Except for the $10 a person minimum charge since not everyone always wants to drink booze or eat on quizo nights.

On some nights they have live bands perform upstairs.  The music tends to be amplified to deafening levels.  Earplugs are great if you have them.

HAF9JECDCzVJ8vdRYdj0ZA,1,"I have a 2011 Toyota Sienna Limited. During the winter the driver's side door stopped operating. I could see that the cable that was inside the door broke. I took the van to the Conicelli Toyota in Springfield, PA. I was presented with a $1500 estimate to replace the door motor and apparatus and I was charged $128 for the service of looking for the problem.  I decided to try and get another estimate as that seemed quite high. As a result of looking into the situation with other people I purchased the cable part directly from a parts company. A friend believed he could replace the part. Although I received the part in December it wasn't until recently that he was able to do the job due to the weather. As a result it was just the cable apparatus that was needed not the motor. The cable apparatus cost $36.63. I feel that Conicelli Toyota was either trying to rip me off big time or they didn't want to be bothered with a small job of replacing the cable apparatus. Either way it says nothing good about this Toyota service location. As a result I will never go back there.

EwY-4k2CKxc6Z8-W7SlIcg,1,"Last year I went into this dealership to purchase my first vehicle. I ended up buying a Jeep Cherokee and although I loved the car, I've regretted going to this dealership. I wish I had looked around more at the time and been more cautious because I without a doubt know I paid too much for it. A couple of days later, my sister decided to trade in her Jeep Wrangler, for another one. I liked our sales person, and everything seemed like it was going fine. 

We both purchased the extended warranty on our cars, and we've both had immense issues with customer service. We were both supposedly given free oil changes for 5 years when we purchased the cars, but when my sister went into get hers, she apparently didn't have the sheets for it. They said they couldn't do anything for her because it could've been the case that she had ""either never been given free oil changes or had sold them to make some money."" Absolutely ridiculous! They had no other way to pull up her information to see what was going on! I would think that a dealership of this size would have a better way of documenting these sorts of things to ensure that customers were covered should there be any sort of issue. She was denied the service, that she had been promised.

I figured that I would have better luck since I found the oil change sheets in a folder I had received when I purchased my car. However, I also had issues with their service! Every time I booked an appointment either to do an oil change or fix a flat tire, they needed something different! Every person I talked to told me something different. I needed the sheet for the oil change, then I needed all the sheets for oil changes I had. For the first flat tire I had I didn't need to provide any paperwork to demonstrate that I had purchased an extended warranty, but then the second time, they wanted to charge me, and refused to look up my information on the computer (which another representative had previously told me was possible)

This month, my car was stolen, and my insurance recommended I contact the dealership to receive some of the money that I had put towards this warranty, that I won't get to use, and I've been completely tossed around. I've tried to get in contact with multiple people, but have yet to hear back. 

My experience was so bad, that now that I am in the market for another vehicle, I am avoiding this dealership, and have decided to avoid Jeep all together! 

Overall, this dealership has some of the worst customer service I have ever come across. Avoid at all costs!",8/17/2015 18:36
u5o_QDwRPQW8gjgFudu9bg,5,"Man, I really lucked out with this trail.  I was on a group camping trip up the road at Lake Cachuma and had this trail scheduled.  They told us it was a 6 mile hike and about 30 minutes into the drive over there I was already ready to go home. lol.  I am not a hiker and it was really hot so I was nervous about being able to hang, and the fact that I was at the mercy of other people was making me sweat.  

Luckily, the swimming hole we found at the end of about a half mile of ""hiking"" was perfect and the group went swimming and after an hour or so they were ready to go back.  If I can make it out here again, I will try to hike the rest of the trail and find the other swimming holes.  

Be prepared for the $10 fee to get into the park.  There will be a person there to collect it and give you a tag.  This spot is not run by the forest service, so the person is not official looking. There are several river crossings you have to pass just to get to the trail head, which can be driven through in a sedan, but probably better if you have a bigger car.  It's about 5 miles in from the point you pay and it is seriously beautiful.  Be careful, look for other cars and don't get distracted by the view, but do enjoy it!

6IeGk4i1BPl2PS5jWZ5OxA,5,"I am a sushiholic and this place knocked my socks off. This is place to be for innovative, new, special rolls. Deep fried spinach and beet flakes, mango, kiwi, coconut flakes - these are the kind of toppings you can expect. 

As a big group, we got many, many rolls. Every one was delicious and different. My favorite was the Mt. Lemon roll (I love lemon slices on sushi) and this one had no rice - just a big ol' bite of crab, lemon and other flavors. The Geisha lips and Golden Lobster were  also very flavorful. The Paris Roll was the most far-out for me, but I loved the variety of smoked salmon, kiwi and and spice. 

I also had a few bites of my sister's Tepan combo w/ filet mignon and lobster with chow mein type noodles - needless to say a very classy sort of fusion dish that was well cooked on both the surf and turf. 

The place is a very Vegas inspired sort of trendy with lots of playful buddhas, fancy modern lights and rich color scheme. As an added benefit Mr. An himself visited our table and he was a very charismatic sort that put the finishing touch on the visit.",2/12/2012 20:08

Long review: Tacos are probably my favorite food group and this place does not just serve yummy tacos, but they are beautiful tacos with flavors that you never expected to taste.  The pickled red onion with a hint of clove was delish.  The ever so subtle cinnamon hiding here and there was such a nice surprise.  My taste buds just wanted to get up and dance!

Piggy Stardust , perfect.  It was beautiful, tasty and the mango habanero sauce was a yummy option. 

I wanted to try more of their beautiful food,  but the tacos come in pairs (psst , how about letting us put two different tacos on a plate ? It would be a heavenly option) so I guess, I will just have to come back another day. 

The space is cozy,  hip and has great local artwork on the walls.  Bruce Maurey's portraits of some of my most beloved musicians hang downstairs and the mural that leads to the upstairs is the handiwork of Cody Rutty.  A live jazz band was being offered on a Monday evening!  Who does that ?  

This place is Boise through and through; casual setting with indoor and outdoor seating options to enjoy great food, art and music; all of it , first rate.

Okay let's begin: I got a half chicken (buttermilk ranch) and two sticky bun donuts to share  with my boyfriend. The half chicken was $9.25 and it was four pieces. I was hoping one would be a wing (it was not). there was one small breast, two thighs and a drumstick. I consider this price to be very very expensive. I don't like the fact that you can't just order pieces of chicken. It's in halves and wholes only. I understand the whole ""more sustainable, more humane"" thing of not ordering multiple wings, but I would be more inclined to come here a lot if it wasn't a $14 brunch. I got the half to share and honestly, I could have eaten three pieces because they were on the smaller end.

The place is large and very clean. It's decorated well and is quite appealing with its fresh pre-prepared salads on display. There isn't a traditional posted menu, per se, but the counter staff were great about helping my first-time self navigate through the process. 

I ended up ordering their pastrami sandwich (coincidentally, they are located next door to Norton's Pastrami which is the most prominent of its kind in town), along with a side order of their pesto green beans.

I've traveled to many beautiful places but I find this to be one of the most peaceful yet enchanting properties poised with magnificence and romance.

Also all laid out on the table and inside the drawer, were food that you'd be charged for had you opened the box. I obviously know that but usually there is a note stating that, and in that case there was not. This makes no sense, but I was only there for a night and i wasn't going to eat the candy anyways. My only issue was the broken Nespresso machine :(

Anyways I simply love it here and it's worth every penny for this priceless view and experience. I hope to be back one day",11/22/2019 17:15

YX2-_LZdzXhU1Q1qdXG8nA,1,"Horrendous experience. Avoid at all costs. I'm one of the unlucky ones who's mother insists on my brother and I taking these pics EVERY YEAR, so I think 32 years if these qualifies me to say this is the WORST company to ever get pictures through. We went to Westgate in Saratoga, CA on 12/8/21

1) Santa insisted we grown adults sit on his lap which as grown adults, is just awkward, uncomfortable and unnecessary 

2) The photographer was deep into his phone, texting away at something and leaving my brother and I to sit on Santa's knees for longer than necessary. Despite us and Santa saying ""hello!"" ""Hi could you take the picture?"" And ""Excuse me?"" several times, we could get his attention and he moved behind the monitor on the desk to continue texting ""out of sight.""

3) Once we took the pictures we had no choice in identifying 1) which pictures we wanted or 2) which package we wanted. So they printed whichever pose they wanted in whichever size they wanted and proceeded to print out the largest most expensive package with the explicit intention of throwing out the ones we don't buy. What a waste of resources AND extra waste all that is completely avoidable. And WHAT!? Why can't we pick the best picture to be printed in the size we want??

4) the ONLY options to purchase your pictures are what's pictured. So as someone who's done this for decades and only wants one 5""x7"" to add to the many other 5""x7"" Santa pics on her mother's wall. This is absurd. 

I STRONGLY do NOT recommend using these services ever again. I'd rather pay someone $40 to sit in a Santa suit and take a singular picture next year and moving forward. Don't waste your time or money here.",12/9/2021 17:38

Don't know what I was expecting here. I ordered the General Tso chicken with crab Rangoons. Now, the crab Rangoons were fine. I mean, they were not mind blowing but I was satisfied. 

The General Tso chicken was okay. The sauce is extremely sweet (which I'm not the biggest fan of) but it was spiced nicely. A lot of Chinese places I've eaten from make this big disclaimer about their General Tso chicken having a kick to it. Theirs SORT of hit the mark. Also glad they don't use that breading that makes the chicken look like large ginger root. Yuck. There is some breading on the chicken though. 

Okay, so now we are down one star based on the above...

The RIIIIIIIIIICE is why they're down two more. I hate to be harsh but it tasted like burned Uncle Ben's 5-minute vegetable rice. I typically love Chinese (and other Asian rice dishes) but that was a disservice. I really feel like the rice was either scorched or severely over cooked. It was not pleasant at all.

jcaPJQg3oXDB4BcLmasiAA,2,".

I usually use a Flowbee for my son's haircuts, and put the $15 we save with each cut into his college account, because it's so easy to do it at home, does a great job, saves gas and time, and it's FREE! 

About 5 weeks ago, my husband decides to take our son for a ""professional"" haircut. One of only 4 he's ever had at a ""salon"". Each time, they have come home regretting it... with a cut worse than anything our Flowbee can accomplish. 

This time was the worst! Even though my husband informed April (the stylist) about our son's congenital triangular alopecia (a small bald spot on one side), she was not paying attention (she was apparently trying to train a new stylist across the room) and cut his hair WAY too short, exposing the bald spot. For the past few weeks, we have had to color in his little bald spot with a Sharpie marker, and 5 weeks later, his hair still has not grown long enough to cover it. Granted, they did not charge for the cut (thus the 2 stars instead of one), and my husband did not tip, he was so mad. But the poor kid is a teenager, and image is extra important at his age. Seriously, stylists, please pay attention! I'm sure you would not want to walk around all self-conscious, being stared at and talked about by your peers, yet this is what our son has had to live with for the past several weeks. 

I usually try to avoid negative reviews, and like to give out more positive ones, but I also think that we should all give our very best to the customers we serve, and to give them our undivided attention. I have thought about this for weeks, and have decided that this should be addressed. Everyone makes mistakes, but the area was shown, specific instructions given, including which blade size to use just prior to the cut, so no excuse! Just pay attention!

#NAME?,5,"No frills, low dollar bills.  That's their slogan, right?  Well if not, it SHOULD be.  Only one or two registers open at any given time, but their cashiers are the fastest this side of the Pecos and can clear a huge line in no time flat.  The products (especially staple items like cheese and milk) are so much cheaper than other supermarkets.  An example is calcium added OJ.  The cheapest I have found it elsewhere (on sale) is around $2.00.  Here, it is $1.69 all the time.  

If you haven't been in a while, it's time to go back.  Their produce used to be limited and half rotten. Now it is fresh and there's a good selection.  Their cheese are no longer limited to cheddar and American -- they have Swiss, blue, feta, cream cheese, Mexican style, just to name a few.  

Make sure to hit their random stuff aisle, where you might find kids toys, kitchen equipment, and gym bags.  You just never know what you will find.

If you haven't been here before, they save money by carrying only their own generic brands, not advertising, not providing bags or baggers, and not having cart collectors.  This means the following for you:
- bring a quarter if you want to rent a shopping cart, and be sure to return it to get your quarter back
- bring your own grocery bags or plan to pay to buy them there (or snag a cardboard box as you are shopping)
- be ready to bag your own groceries on the ledge after cashing out (just like the Germans! Don't you feel exotic?)",1/28/2015 0:03

This place has definitely gone through some evolution since it has been opened.   The quality of the food has improved which is great because at $14, that hamburger had better be amazing.

Their burgers have come a long way since open.  I dont mind paying for burgers here as clearly some time has gone into them and they are delicious....$30 for two hamburgers is hard to get past sometimes though.

Wife and I went last night on a whim and just to switch it up I ordered a Caesar salad and a side of onion rings.  

I have to be totally honest here - the Caesar Salad looked like it was one of those pre-made ones in the airport for $11, but it was in a restaurant for $11 (well, $10.25).

It was literally just a bowl of romaine with some Parmesan strips.  If I'm totally honest, it was sad. 

If it was $6 that would be one thing but I believe that a lot of people would agree with me that if it's something you could make at home in three minutes, it shouldn't cost $10.

We tried another shake and got this big one this time which was much better than the tiny one.

When all was said and done, the bill was about $36-$38 for a burger, salad, side of onion rings, fries and a milkshake, before tip.  Since the service is always good we like to tip 20%, so now we are flirting with $50 for burger lunch....

Sadly the Curtis response was not dissimilar in fashion, to what others are reporting

Curtis was not at all interested in their lack of service

Cheryl Curtis just rambled on about numerous topics
ie; 
Number of incoming phone lines, business structure...
Really Cheryl? 
To your customer these details are of no relevance
Seemingly it was anything she could come up with to obfuscate my issues
It went so far as;
Cheryl weaving a tale that I was contacted, by her no less
I was never contacted, remember this is what started my epic adventure
I am told internally Curtis did contact themselves, well that's swell
Cheryl bested her own incompetence by:
Telling me I was lying about the conversation between her employee and myself. 
Oddly this is was a conversation Cheryl was not privy to
Though she did remain absolute in her knowledge of its contents
note Cheryl never asked this employee what transpired
The conversation was regarding the following days schedule and what would transpire.

Oy Vey, in all Curtis has gone done the drain

The Internets yielded some great corollaries to my own experience:

Zee2O3kDiBwJyHN2a33uhA,1,"Well I have had trouble with their billing dept for MANY YEARS.  It seems by the comments here, A LOT of other patients have as well!   I just received a bill for my co pay, and I had paid it 7 weeks ago when I was in there.  I called and they said they do have me paying it......then why send me a bill??              BUT they said that I have a bill in COLLECTIONS for a bit over $130 !!!!!!!!!!!  I can only assume that this is from 2014-2018 when they double billed me and refused to honor their contract with my ins co by accepting what the ins paid with my co pay.  They actually tried to get me to pay the difference that my ins didn't pay!  The ins co told me they CANNOT do that to a patient since they have a contract with them.    PH has to accept what the ins co pays them along with my co pay...and that is it!   Then pima (have no) heart double billed me.  They also billed me for an appt where the doctor didn't show and I was told he was stuck in the hospital (he wasn't...he told me he was home sick)   They knew yet they didn't call me to cancel the appt and I had to drive 45 min one way to get there.   
SERIOUSLY.....how in the world can I trust a company (which is what PH is) when their billing is so unethical and illegal in their practices?????   Even my doctor there said they push too much and give him too many patients to rush thru.  What should be a 20-25 min appt is in reality only 5 to 7 minutes!!   How accurate can a doctor be in that short period of time?? Especially when dealing with YOUR HEART???    My last appt a couple months ago was rushed thru...The doctor left the room before I had a chance to finish asking my questions!!!   I had thought he was coming back...never did.  He was only there 4 minutes.  My trust in this place to care for my heart issues is totally gone.

sbVPOGXCoU87oT8zI5pw9Q,3,"Having been a member since the day it opened, I'll give my honest assessment:

I feel like the value of my membership is easily earned by the free classes they offer as well as the overall quality of the equipment, the facility and the pool.  Considering I dont even use the basketball, squash, yoga or pilates, I think there is something for everyone here - to an extent.  

What is not so great about it is the HARD and i mean HARD selling that goes on among the trainers there.  When my wife joined, she looked for someone to just take 30 minutes to show her the equipment on the main gym floor.  2 minutes later, the trainer was trying to talk her into a $190+ dollar package for monthly training and how they don't really do one-off sessions.  It is like the $90-$120 you pay per month just kind of gets you in the door and there's little help beyond that.

I also have a couple of friends locally that have heard me rave about the gym but I cant seem to get them in because the guest-passes are prohibitive. I get why they dont want people inviting herds of guests into the pool at summertime but this place would not lose money by letting me take a co-worker before 4pm to one of the morning classes that I take.  

Also, the LT Bucks are an absolute joke.  They were sold to us as being able to be used anywhere and after learning we cant use them in the Cafe (no big deal) we tried to sign up for a group class and turns out they aren't dollar-for-dollar.  So we wanted to use some of our LT bucks to shave off the price of a monthly premium class and apparently the LT Bucks only get you a free week of the class, so you get 5 weeks for the price of 4, not 4 weeks for a reduced price.  You are also locked into 2 months the moment you sign up for a class since each class requires 30-day notice to cancel.  Navigating the frustrating add-on services and the complete joke of a program known as LT Bucks is daunting. It is easily my least favorite part of the Gym.  I'm not a picky individual and trust me, it is a pain.

If you have some background in fitness and can make the most out of what is there, the gym is great - and there's a ton to offer.",10/3/2017 19:54

The four sauces are a win with everything and there's something for everyone- from spicy to cherry to plain mustard and my personal favourite bourbon. 

You can't go without having the brisket. But the fried chicken is so crispy you will regret not getting it. And the ribs. They are fall off the bone ....  ok so they have a meat sampler but don't forget the sides. Not only do you need some veg like your mama said but they are delicious!

Rs22rEx7sI7AfReAIAG2jg,2,"Unfortunately, this is the first review I'm posting that is unfavorable.  The door was locked upon arrival, as I walked away the owner Pie came out to greet us and explain the restaurant is not open so there's only outside dining.  After being seated my daughter and I requested water with lemon. There were no other patrons there yet it took a while to receive it.  We ordered an appetizer and sushi to enjoy along with the Yelp Elite Entree.  I enjoyed the stuffed jalapeños but the sushi was warm and not rolled tight.  We then waited an hour for the fish tacos!  They were a disappointment because they came out cold and dry!  Additionally, the menu should state its Tilapia.  I don't eat this type of fish, therefore I did not eat it.  My daughter ate a bite of hers and agreed it was not good at all.  The owner/manager was the only person taking care of everything.  Although there were only four tables she appeared overwhelmed.  Three different parties came and left due to the slow service.  I asked to use the restroom.  She stated sure but give me a few minutes.  When granted access i could see the restaurant is no where near completion, there's stuff everywhere piled up!  The bathroom had no a/c do it was stuffy and the trash was filled so clearly it needed attention.  I'm total were were there around 1/2 hours and left as soon as the tacos arrived. 

My recommendation is they should have waited to host the event when the restaurant was done and had ample staff.",6/26/2021 16:15

Dont let the pics on line fool you, the items for sale at the convenience area..snack, drinks and such had maybe a handful of mini chip bags and a few romin noodle cups.  Not appealing.

I've been in luxury sales and have a clear understanding of the sales process from lead generation to closing and could write a book on all the propoganda tools  used in the process to direct your customer to a close.  I advised my salesperson (still new) that I was not a big fan of pointless repeated contacts and that if I wanted the vehicle after checking it out, that I would buy it.  Plain and simple.   All went well, I bought it.   1 month later and I've received no less than 10 followups from the dealership in the form of phone calls from my salesperson asking about referrals and hoping my vehicle is everything I wanted.  Mileage requests for extended warranty qualification, service work coupon mailers,  requests for reviews of my experience and to rate the followups.  I even get a phone call from my salesperson thanking me for my business and asking for referrals AGAIN- when just hours earlier I received a recall notice (salesman obviously oblivious to this because he doesn't even mention it).  

Yes, I agree it is important to follow up with customers.  But your number of soliciatations rivals those of Charter Spectrum.  If I need your services, I know where you are.

Stop calling me, stop sending me mailings for your service department. DO NOT CONTACT unless you are 1)Providing recall notice, 2)Sending me cash or check.

qhlJJdSUPgBBF6EwnJv5YQ,1,"My wife and I have been bringing our pets to Baring Animal Hospital since well before we were married. We will celebrate our twenty-sixth wedding anniversary in May. Baring has literally cared for six dogs and three cats, helping us to part with five of those pets, in that time. We have also spent thousands and thousands of dollars with Baring Animal Hospital. We consider ourselves very loyal to local businesses and ALWAYS give businesses the opportunity to correct issues. I HAVE NEVER VOCALIZED THIS EXTENSIVE OF AN ISSUE WITH ANY BUSINJESS BEFORE.

Since ""VCA"" appeared in their name, the quality of service and cost of treatment at Baring has reacted inversely and proportional. The first has sunk into a pit and the second has skyrocketed.  I have been severely overcharged for service, left in the parking lot for literally hours with zero communication, left on hold until I hung up and called back several times, sold services that my pets just don't need, and the straw that broke my back, their refusal to see my injured dog because they ""don't provide emergency services or walk-ins."" There is more. 

At every instance, I have communicated my frustration, sometimes forcefully, and have consistently been dismissed; generally with just a shrug and a , ""sorry about that.""

I love this place. I love the decor. I love the ... manager, I guess he is, who is personable, funny and a little weird. I love the server, who is also personable, funny and, a little weird. I hope if they read this, they recognize it as the compliment I mean it to be. 

I love the lo mein. Sometimes, I want to try the fried rice, but, then, I wouldn't have the lo mein! That just would not be correct! But, I did have a lunch special, once, wherein I had to have steamed rice and I enjoyed that, too. 

I have had the sesame chicken twice, a taste of orange chicken once,  broccoli beef once, a taste of Spicy Tofu once, Teriyaki chicken once, Thom Ka chicken (I think I spelled that right) once, and,  Ginger Tofu only the once. The Teriyaki chicken suffered by comparison to the other dishes, but, was pretty good compared to other things I had from other places. 

I have been told their drunken noodles and margaritas are fabulous, but, have no personal experience. I do like their unsweetened tea, which is nice and strong, but, not too strong. 

I love their egg drop soup and hot and sour soup. 

The lunch prices are lovely. 

Oh, and, I forgot: I had some spicy won tons once and their spring rolls, as part of a meal, twice, and, a little of one of their more expensive dishes that had shrimp and squid (and, maybe, also chicken).

Run people, run!  I paid for color match paint for an up charge, and a non suction bath mat sold by his wife.  Post painting the tub has an entirely new texture, part over spray drip, some under spray beads and sandpaper scratches.  The owner Randy and his wife refused  to come see the work performed by their employee.  Randy was extremely unprofessional and rude to boot.

It's been almost 2 years now.  My tub finish has rubbed off in some spots.  The bath mat has pulled up the paint in 80% of the bottom.  The worst $ we ever spent!",8/10/2016 11:39
FdH_3gnLR7vW_2ZmLAejiw,5,"I came to Biscuit Love, solo, ambitious, and determined to finally tackle the line and judge the hype once and for all. 

After waiting about ~40 minutes outside, I put my mask on, enter the doors, and start checking out the merch.

Then suddenly, as my body usually and conveniently likes to do in social situations in foreign areas, I start to feel extremely light headed. My vision is slowly blurring and I can no longer hear the hustle and bustle of biscuits being ordered and brown sugar lemonades being poured. 

Next thing I know, I sway towards the windows and three ladies in front of me are holding me by my arms as my knees are almost touching the ground. A BL employee runs to get me a chair, cup of orange juice, and a wet towel. 

Within minutes, my vision and hearing returns and people are asking me if I am diabetic and offering me donuts. I reply that this ""happens all the time"" but in addition I am 4 months pregnant so it could be a combo of factors. The same BL employee from earlier gets me a seat at the bar and ensures I am okay. I finally feel normal again and able to place my order of biscuit and sausage gravy and bonuts to go. 

My food came out quickly and when I hand over my card she says, ""it's on house."" Not only was I cured by biscuits, but my fainting, pregnant, southern California ass was given the infamous and utmost ~southern hospitality~!!! 

I was too disheveled to get this woman's name, but she was wearing a backwards hat. If you are reading this or know who I am talking about, please send me her name and give her a shoutout, raise, and the world for being such a genuine caretaker. I am incredibly and infinitely thankful!

Iu6bkhCmMyHwJboJdxLw5g,1,"I got a good deal on the vehicle I purchased, every Vehicle is sold ""As-Is"". The Carfax was clean. But 4 days after I bought it, I noticed the parking sensors System was shut off. I turned it on and warning bells & whistles that the vehicle needed to go to the dealership. The dealership told me the rear bumper was removed and therefore voided the warranty because there was obviously work done but not by a certified dealership. But NBD, that's my fault, I should have made sure that everything worked before I put pen to paper. The GPS SD was missing but the owner said to me (before I bought it) that one was ordered from the dealership and it was no problem. So I got the GPS card from them and installed it. DID NOT WORK! The dealership said the card SD card is married to the system and if you try to remove one from another car it will not work. I called Discovery and explained that there was an issue. I was told it's not their fault they had no idea there was work done the bumper(yea ok), I seen ur guys out back taking cars apart, so that's a lie! I at least wanted them to reimburse me the costs of fixing the GPS that also controlled other features.  Well my salesman said the card was bought from EBay (after the owner said it was ordered from the dealership) and if I wanted to, I could try to recoup by selling a SD (that is completely worthless) to someone else. Yea I'm not that kind of scum bag...Wow! Well, I love the vehicle so that's a great thing but there's one thing for sure...they will NEVER get my Biz again & I'll be sure to tell ALL of my Military Vet friends to steer clear. They have NO integrity, not transparent at all and once you sign the ppwk, they could care less about you & ANY issues you may have  The only part of the process that was good was the financing, our guy was AWESOME!  So if your reading this...look at the other reviews, the owner comments on great reviews but not bad ones. Maybe not because you can't please every customer, but more of they don't GAF about you once they sold u the vehicle. Take this as a warning, this dealership is not bad but they are NOT honest brokers for damn sure. Take your hard earned $ else where or you might be sorry you didn't.",2/28/2020 16:55

So, after being disappointed with his bike that he bought on the internet about a year ago which broke almost immediately, he started researching bikes with close to 5 stars online.  We went to a place in Hammond near his college and had a bad experience with Gray Cat cycles.  We decided to look at bike shops either in or near the New Orleans area. We went to one bike shop Bayou bikes or something like that and my son told the lady there what he was looking for and actually she told us to check out Dashing.  She said that they moved to a new location so I called to make sure of the address.  The man who answered the phone was so polite and told me the address and we went there and was actually greeted outside the door because I told him that I couldn't  find the building but knew I had to be nearby. He helped my son right away.  My son purchased a Retrospect Harper in a matte olive green.  He purchased a kick stand which was installed there in the shop.  The bike totaled about $340.00 with the kickstand.  It is the bike of his dreams, and loves riding it.  It will be used mostly to get around the college campus.  I was so impressed as how knowledgeable and caring the staff was that I brought my bike to the store to purchase 2 new tires and to get a little tune up on it.  I was told that it may take around a few days to get it back or a week.  I got a call a couple of hours later that my bike was ready!!!!! People truly do make a difference.

qPeJFThfFz_bYoN3z3oQNw,5,"There is so much I could say about this studio, the coaches, and staff. Firstly, the workout is always killer and I have lost nearly 40 lbs since starting at OTF! I went from power walking to jogging and still appreciate the ways I can modify to fit my needs.

The front staff has been nothing short of amazing. I was having trouble booking and they assisted me, helping me to create a schedule that works for me. I have also gone through some medical issues and personal trauma that required a last minute cancellations, and they worked with me to sort it out. Special shout-out to my girls Kim and Molly and my guys Rasheed and John. 

The coaches, particularly Katie and Sally because their class times are the ones I can make, are amazing. I always feel supported, seen, and also challenged. It has helped me see tremendous growth in strength, speed, and other non-scale victories. 

I love the social aspect of OTF too. There's challenges, socials, celebrations of Pride and Black History Month.

Overall, such a solid experience. #MoreLife",8/4/2021 20:02

rBeKFxV0PJ-wXMjaEa8G5A,5,"This is one of my favourite Edmonton festivals. It all started in 1976 with 11 communities taking part. Now more than 40 years later it has grown to more than 60 pavilions representing 85 different cultures. This is always a great opportunity to try food you have never tried or even heard of. You can also learn a lot about each culture at their pavilion. Buy some of their cultural items and experience some of their entertainment.

The site for this festival is Hawrelak Park and it is so huge it pretty much takes up the entire park so be prepared for lots of walking. It seems like this weekend is also usually one of the hottest weekends of the year so make sure you bring water or be prepared to buy on site for a bit of a premium.

This is also one of the biggest food raisers for the Edmonton Food Bank. If the weather is bad and the crowds stay away then it can impact that organization quite negatively. So make sure you bring a good donation for the Food Bank too!

KLpm1RqdBHkjQx_JlyWZvw,3,"Surprisingly, there aren't that many Americanized Chinese restaurants in the CBD/French Quarter. As good as Cajun/Creole food may be, one just has the need to fill their belly with some greasy Chinese stuff every once in a while.

That being said, this spot hits the spot. The place is huge - probably to accommodate drunk tourists at night - and they're usually pretty busy, and the staff was pretty friendly as well.

For the price tag, the portions are pretty sizable. Even their lunch specials have more than average portion. Another thing I like about this joint is that you have the option to get the shrimp fried rice for your lunch menu - which I've never seen.

As for the important stuff - the taste, they're pretty average. Their general tso's chicken, of which I ordered it extra spicy, wasn't spicy at all, but it was on par with mediocre Chinese restaurants across the country. 

The thing I shocked me about this place is the inconsistency from their menu description from the website. When you look at the menu from Grubhub, the plain fried rice is described as, ""Prepared steamed white rice with soy sauce, eggs, peas, carrots and green onions."" Look at the picture of the plain fried rice I'd received - what a joke. There was not a whiff of the eggs, peas, carrots or green onions. They really need to work on the menu. Not only that, it tasted just like white rice mixed with soy sauce, and it tasted ridiculously bad. Their pork fried rice, on the other had, was pretty good. Mild, and lots of pork pieces.

Also, their baby corn that was in my bean curd went bad - it tasted awful.

All in all, I would go there again, as long as I stick to the stuff that I know already, like general tso's chicken.",3/14/2019 2:16

Walked in and was greeted with ""Welcome home!"" Excuse me?! Um, I love this place already. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles and the poached eggs with nova (like lox). The waffle was SO good. I don't know what they put in there, but it's the closest thing I've tasted to the most delicious waffle I've ever had, and that was in Belgium. The chicken was fried to perfection and so crunchy I almost hurt myself. My poached eggs had that nice luxurious run over my muffins when I cut it open, and everything was perfect.

These people are the worst I have ever dealt with. In a three party real estate sale, one in which the parties are estranged and adversarial, Republic Land and Title sent the WRONG paperwork to the parties, exposing physical addresses and yes, even Social Security numbers, to each other! They almost killed a five figure sale by neglecting to inform the sellers that they would only accept voided checks with preprinted name and address of the account holders to set up direct deposit of sale proceeds. Only hours before closing, we had to scramble to get letters from our banks to allow electronic payment to be made. 

Wen a complaint call about the botching of the paperwork by one of their employees was made, the owner/principal kept repeating that it was ""our policy"" despite the fact that it was not included in their detailed instructions on how to complete the paperwork.

I was buying large amounts of their dog mix for a good six months or more. A few months back Christine called and asked if I wanted to buy some old frozen dog mix at a discount they found in their freezer.  I was happy to do so.  I didn't buy all of it.  Unfortunately my dog did not like it.  I continued ordering fresh batches going forward but noticed the last batch I purchased had a few packages of what looked like that old stuff.  Very easy to tell the difference.  I brought it to Christine's attention, which she denied and also went on to tell me no one has ever complained.  First; poor attitude towards your customer and not true according to another review here on Yelp.  What also makes me doubt she was telling the truth; they don't date their packages anymore.

rzFuz9Fh-Nmf_rmO4U2KQA,1,"I happily ordered a $135 hoagie tray in person on Friday and paid for it in advance in person in CASH so I could run in on Sunday and pick it up 
I had my grandson and little nephews coming to a pumpkin decorating party at 1pm at my house 

This day was a literal nightmare.I don't have enough words to describe what went on in their shop today. When I got in to pick up my tray I was told by the manager I didn't pay for it .  I gave his the "" future order"" rcpt that was given to me and he said that doesn't prove I paid for anything. I don't have another $135 laying around. I went through my step-by-step with him so that he would understand that I had paid for it. He didn't budge. HE EVEN SAID HE REMEMBERED ME COMING IN AND SAID HE WAS SURE I DIDNT PAY.  Horror set it. The party was starting at 1 o'clock. I stopped by to pick up my order at 10:30.  An hour and a half later I begged and pleaded and tried to make sense but f it . The self proclaimed manager would make no iContact with me , told me he was going to put me out of the store if I continued. and claimed he was on the phone with the owner (while he giggled and smiled ) during his 30 minute call. I think he felt if he ignored me I would go away.  Customers came in and out and couldn't understand why I was there crying. I live nearby I've been a customer  on and off for 12 years.  
My son-in-law offered to pay AGAIN but I said I would not pay twice OVER MY DEAD BODY and this was unfair. It was a freaking tray of hoagies. COMMIN SENSE - Why would I stand there for an hour and a half  crying over a tray of hoagies if I was trying to steal it. Once the owner arrived I was told that was impossible IMPOSSIBLE , IMPOSSIBLE that I had paid for it. Also he said ""I heard you yelling while I was on the phone (so what?) He said That they don't take payments before pick up. That their cash register wouldn't even open on a preorder(?) (it opened fine when they took my money on Friday) 
I explained that I did not know what went on on their side of the counter but on my side for a fact I paid in cash. They were more than rude.  They were  belittling with lots of eye rolling , smirks, giggles, accusations , I was told Again and again and again that I was wrong. That I had not paid and I was not getting my hoagie tray.  I'm in disbelief. 
Honestly, I do not look or act like a thief. If I was a thief Why would I stand there in public and cry and insist and plead for an last hour and a half.  Can't they check the register recpts? What the hell. 

Finally at almost 1pm the owner reviews the video from friday !!! He was so rude and so sure of himself Had to REVIEW THE STORE VIDEO... are you kidding me ?? He called me in the back quickly and told me that he had proof that I did not pay. But for some reason he had stopped the video 5 seconds too early...( what the heck ) I asked him to continue the video for another 10 seconds and there it was, me paying in cash for my platter. The cashier putting my money in the register .  The self proclaimed manager seemed disappointed..as I came out ....( He was smiling when I went back to the owners excitement that he had proof)
Seemed upset that I was correct.  let me remind you this was a hoagie tray it's what they sell day and night.  what did they plan to do with my hoagies if they ran me out of the shop????  Ruined my day. My night and left a huge imprint on me. Wasted my time- I felt like I aged 10 years.  I have NEVER EVER HAD THE INSINUATION THAT I WAS A CROOK BESTOWED ON ME   and I'm a 63 year old nice decent lady. Even after that it was like pulling teeth to get someone to help me get the tray to my car. The manager wouldn't touch it. All I can say is that I am still crying on the inside that they put me through this.  They were mad and weirdly mad.   

This has so UNSETTLED ME.. feels like I had a crazy bad dream. Two hours in their shop and they WOULDNT EVEN admit that it was possible possible they made a mistake .  They was no waivering that it was even remotely possible that I paid and they made a
Mistake.   No chance. Zero zip nada 
I AM SO MAD AT WHAT THEY PUT ME THRU JUST TO PROVE THEY WERE RIGHT when they weren't.  I had to ASK , yes ASK for an apology.  Not even a discount on my order for a 2 hour ordeal.  No one wanted to apologize.
Not good or  honorable people.  I HOPE IT WAS WORTH THEIR TIME.  They forever lost my business and 15 of my local friends and relatives but that's nothing compared to how I feel about this. .  
I'm still shaking .  I have a question.... If I was unable to prove that I paid .. what were they planning to do with the hoagies throw them away.? They need to learn a lesson here. Respect your customers have sympathy and consideration
If this from my hoagie shop at that point I would have just given the trade to the lady .. out of pity. I mean they were obscene",10/17/2021 23:52

HBoYn6TUFcx9vciA3odJ9g,1,"I wanted a replacement for our aging van, searched online a very long time.  Found one myself, contacted the dealership, and paid the 250,00 transfer fee.  I had to call them to see if it had gotten there and received no follow up call to let me know it had gotten there, which got my attention.
--The vehicle was in good shape, and looked good and mileage was accurate, road tested good,  although i noticed the rear tires had a noticeable saw tooth pattern on the outside edges, and during the paperwork stage i brought up to the sales man the problem and asked to have them replaced with a matching set just on the rear and rotate to the front.  The sales man said he would create a service ticket for it to go in for repairs. I asked for them to furnish roof rack crossover bars, a second key fob, and an owners manual. Funny thing is, the KIA Dealership is within spitting distance, right next door.  they valued my trade at 500.00, which was meticulously maintained albeit 12 years old and valued at trade 1000.00 minimum. I also asked to refund the transfer fee since I committed to buying the van.  Here is how the purchase went:
--I could not use my van as trade and get money off for the sales tax, which hurt.  I ended up selling it myself 4 months later for 1750.00. 
--They said they would not furnish new tires, that they passed their rigorous inspection standards on the initial checkout, which i picked out on the lot (to be fair, i am an ex mechanic.)
--They would not refund the transfer fee.
--They would not get us a new fob, again the KIA dealer was next door and they had a week to do it.
--They would not get the roof crossover bars, a 350.00 expense, again available next door.
--They said to go on the website for a paper version for the owner's manual on Helminc.com, not avail.  on KIA's website.  They state that they will reimburse you if you have to buy it.
--Long story short, I bought the manual, showed them the shipping receipt and credit card charges since KIA would not give me the receipt in the package or when i called them (KIA) showed the Lady at the counter at CARMAX my proof of purchase, said she could not get me a 25.00 refund since it was not actually a receipt. I gave up after that. This was the final punch in the stomach/ fart in the face I got from them.  
--I will never buy a car from them again, and not recommend them either.",12/9/2016 3:06
zpWizDgUk4-rQJXdjiBY1w,2,"Pros:
- Location ~2 miles from to several downtown and shopping areas; close enough for us
- Grocery Outlet is next door
- Pool looked clean and everyone socially distanced around the pool
- Bed sheets and covers are thin enough that it makes me believe the entire bed set was washed, but that's just a hopeful assumption
- Tv worked

Cons:
- This place is supposed to be covid clean, but considering the parking lot was full outside... I doubt that rooms are being left empty for more than 12 hours before the next guest comes in.
- Hair on the floor in the bathroom
- Dirty tiled floor in general... I would being sandals to walk around this hotel room
- Fridge was unplugged, not cold, and it was dirty. We chose to keep our stuff on ice in the car over putting it in the fridge.
- Thin walls
- Spotty wifi

You can catch some beautiful views of the Benjamin Franklin bridge and some Philly skyscrapers. The inside is pretty well maintained, the lawn could use some geese poo cleaning, but with the lawn chairs available it was less noticeable after sunset!  

They have all kinds of fast food and drinks available, but be prepared to pay $$$$  . Beers start from 13 bucks but you get a $5 shots after that. So also be prepared to see a lot of drunk people lol.. 
the fries there were pretty good! The bathrooms are functioning and neat. Not too long lines which was great! 

The only sad/mad experience was that they make you park at least 4 blocks away and that also cost 30$ . Then when I parked and got to the entrance they said I can't carry my bag, the bag only had a picnic blanket. So had to go all the way back to put the bag in the car and walk back again.

With all of the stylist being busy, they decided to have the cleanup lady cut the sew-in out of my hair! Upon undoing my own braids I removed chucks of hair that looked like my own.. After waiting almost 2 hours I decided to leave.. I did my own relaxer that day, which I usually always do.. Since my hair had been bone straight and I don't usually investigate the back of my head.. I didn't notice until about 3 months down the line how much hair the cleanup lady had cut out of my head!!!!!! Now sitting here months after with one side of the back of my head being totally uneven, i'm on the verge of just shaving the back off! -_- In the end I'm just glad I left before they tried putting the relaxer in my head without combing it first. One of the stylist said my hair was too thick and they would have to put the relaxer on before untangling it. Which is another reason I left. I'm no stylist but I know a relaxer should NOT be done without untangling it first!!! They would have had to cut most of my hair off if I didn't have enough sense and actually let them do it!

The rep insisted that the appointment needed to be same day as there were already people in the neighborhood. 

Then, I was put on the phone with a dispatcher to ""send someone out"", indicating people were actually not in the area at all.  

That raised some red flags for me. Then, both the female rep and the male dispatcher were insistent that my husband be there for the measurement of the windows. That told me that perhaps the measurement appointment was not going to be just measurement. (Something later confirmed when I looked at the BBB reviews of the company.

VsWNYa6IdLv4X9sWUHOPgA,1,"This place has a great location, a great building, good beer, and pretty decent food, but there's no reason that anyone should subject themselves to the treatment that the owner, management and a portion of the staff here give customers.  I don't know if it's still going on, but a couple of the employees at the Brewpub used to pull a scam to steal from customers.  About a year and a half ago, realizing that they had done this to my table on my way out the door, I tried to turn around to talk to a manager.  The person at the door insisted that I couldn't turn around without (re)paying their $10 cover charge.  I explained that I just wanted to go back in to clear up a bill issue with the manager, and they still refused to let me in.  I offered that, if they preferred, they could ask the manager to come to the door, at which point their security guard began to threaten me.  At that point, I figured that the small amount that they'd stolen wasn't worth the trouble of dealing with them.

The next day, I called to tell a manager about what had happened.  I would have thought that he'd be glad that someone told him, instead of just steering people away from the place silently.  When I finished the story, the manager asked ""Why the **** are you telling me?""  So, I asked to speak to the owner.  The owner was audibly drunk and yelled ""You people all just want something for nothing!!! [A bunch of expletive laden nonsense.]"" (Mind you, I wasn't asking for anything.)

After that, I, obviously, was reluctant to go back.  Some friends cajoled me into it a couple of weeks ago, though, and the experience was again poor.  My food came out cold.  I asked if they could reheat it but the waiter seemed unable to handle that on his own.  The manager came over and told me that he knew I just wanted my meal for free and that he wasn't going to do it.  In the end, my food was never reheated.

The owner of the Brewpub and some of his managers are truly abusive people.  You're online, so you can find plenty of more egregious stories of their misconduct for yourself.  As much as this place has going for it, do not risk going here.  Hopefully, after alienating enough people, they will go out of business and someone capable of treating others with basic dignity will take over that location.",10/6/2013 2:30
VKR6JjRyQdDzlcR0mh7hsQ,1,"Friendly staff, wait times are usually very low.  However, DO NOT ever think that a follow up with them is that. I had a bicycle accident, went in for the severe brush burn on my leg, the first doc didn't feel the need to x-ray. Was prescribed antibiotics and pain meds. The next day the leg was twice the size it was the day before. I called and asked if I should follow up there or at my regular physician and was advised that I could definitely follow up there. I specifically asked if there would be another co-pay and was told no. AND IN FACT, they collect your co-pay before you are seen and when I arrived they didn't collect a co-pay. NOW i'm being charge a $50.00 co-pay for that visit because of ""additional/different"" services were provided....the follow up doctor decided to x-ray. I was not advised that these services would trip a ""co-pay"" and was not asked to pay a co-pay before I left.  I would have refused the x-rays had I known.  Lack of communication on their part has cost me an additional $50.00. Oh, and don't try to dispute the charge....very uncooperative!",4/13/2012 17:53

3yBFzrJoI4K4tEgDYoB14g,1,"I booked a round trip on Spirit from New Orleans to Los Angeles on 4/13 to return on 4/17. I was visiting my dying father in law. Knowing that because of the circumstances, I might have to change my return flight, I paid an extra fee to have the flexibility to change my return flight with no penalty. When I went online to try to do so, I searched return flights on alternate days. I checked all flights from Los Angeles to New Orleans over an entire week and in each case I got the message that no seats were available. When I called to inquire, I was told that seats were available on all the flights I asked about but I would have to book the flight over the phone and I would have to pay a penalty because I wasn't making the change online. Really? Make no seats available and then charge me an additional $432 because I had to make the change by phone? This is a total rip off. I would stay away",5/2/2018 15:21

4HyI0RM7-w-mWzh8zuTLMA,1,"Food was mostly alright, I'll further address the food in a moment. The waiter took an hour to bring out the appetizers, then another hour to bring out the entrees. I don't blame him for the excruciating wait on the appetizers because they were hot so obviously he brought them out when they were done, but the entrees weren't as hot, so I don't know who to blame for that. 

Now the food. My pasta was fine, my mom liked her fish, but my sister literally couldn't get her fork through the redfish. It was like tough steak. How does that happen? How do you completely change what fish is? It was insane. Crazy.",11/7/2021 0:17
WGo1yZcJBNYNa7t50GsXeQ,5,"Yesterday about 3 pm I was on my way back to Tempe from Tucson with my 2 children when my car started smoking.  I made my way to the closest mechanic that was open on Saturday, praying that they would be able to take care of the problem. 

The guys who work at this location were literally an answer to my prayers--a total Godsend!!  I am so grateful for these guys.  Thank you, thank you, thank you so much!!!

They say that an honest mechanic is worth his weight in gold. I've got to tell you, these guys are totally platinum! They were incredibly honest and wonderfully skillful and they fixed the problem, also checking all of my fluids in addition  to everything else to make sure that I could get back home to Tempe safely in my car! 

The best part about it is this: the entire bill, even with as much time as they took making sure my car would run OK and as much they did to repair it, was only $18!!!

I was amazed!

The thing is that I didn't know what I was going to do when my car started breaking down.  We had checked out of our hotel and had nowhere to stay that night and knew no one in Tucson.  I didn't have a lot of money for costly repairs and didn't know what I was going to do.  I was really stuck and really at the mercy of whatever the mechanic would say.

It is a real testament to the character of the people who work at this location that they were so honest and so honorable.  I can't tell you how much it meant to me. I am so grateful to God for answering my prayers, and so grateful to these guys for being that answer and being there when I really needed them.

If you live near these guys, you have a fantastic and incredibly honest mechanic!! A++++++++",8/6/2012 4:22
4uukPEe-95HbrjwJ5FPqxg,2,"My husband arrived early Sunday morning and it was pretty empty. Only the booths were half full at the time and all the center tables were still empty. Anyways... It took 20 minutes to get water. The couple who came in 10 minutes after us had already gotten water and put their order in before we even got water. By that point, we knew what we wanted to order so as soon as we got our water we wanted to put in the order ASAP because we were starving. I ordered the stuffed french toast and my husband orders the biscuits & Gravy. Nothing came with a side of eggs and bacon or anything like that. Most places offer sides with your entree. You had to pay extra so we ordered the extra sides because we were hungry. The french toast was just two pieces of bread with a slab of cream cheese in the middle with a raspberry sauce. Not worth $10 by any means. Maybe if it was more than two pieces of bread and it included the sides it would have been worth $10. The sausage and eggs I got on the side tasted like they were frozen and thrown in a microwave. My husband got the biscuits and gravy and the plate was tiny and the biscuits were just small. We definitely overpaid for the quality and quantity of food we got. We left still hungry and ate right when we got home. Next time we will go somewhere else that serves a big breakfast.",6/5/2018 22:43
eRiN8bclHjx9kTAcwYB8mg,1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! 

First time hiring a moving company and to say I'm less than impressed would be an understatement. Hiring the movers was painless, on and off the phone in 10 minutes, fine. 

Movers were scheduled for Saturday arriving between 9 and 10 am. Hourly rate is $150/hr for 2 movers at 3 hours minimum, first time mover so I didn't question it. 

10:15am of move day comes around and other than a confirmation email 4 days prior, nothing. No call confirming them being on the way, so I decided to call-8 times-- to see what was causing the delay. No answer, okay, weird. Their location is 5 minutes from my house, so I drive there to speak to someone in person. 1431 Ivy Hill Rd location listed in Google and THEIR WEBSITE isn't even Sunshine Movers!! The business there is Public Storage, when I walked inside they had no idea who Sunshine Movers were. 

I nearly broke my thumbs calling my bank to reverse my deposit with them, no issues on their end. 

2.5 hours later after the maximum arrival time I get a text from Jay from Sunshine, which I did not consent to being contacted via text and after the text I called back and after a less than satisfactory apology he tried to proceed with the moving services. HARD PASS as we had already hired another moving company last minute who sent 4 men (double the movers) for the same hourly price!! 

Save. Your. Money. 

Shop around before committing on a moving company, this is not the place you want to do business with.",11/21/2020 17:24
